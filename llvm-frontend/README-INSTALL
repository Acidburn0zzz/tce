Building and installation
=========================

It is recommend you install the tce-llvm-gcc to the same prefix you installed
the TCE in. The following uses the 'tce-config' script to figure out the
prefix of TCE.

Ensure that the script is found by executing the following command:

    tce-config --prefix

In case the result is empty, you should add TCE's bin directory to your 
PATH environment variable before continuing.

Next, build and install the tce-llvm-gcc as follows:

	autoreconf
	mkdir build && cd build
	../configure --prefix=$(tce-config --prefix)
	make && make install

Library and tools version prerequisites
=======================================

You need 'flex' or 'bison'. They should be found in all Linux distributions.

Troubleshooting
===============

* Compiling fails when your CXX or CC has a compilation command with
multiple words, e.g., "ccache g++". A workaround is to use a script which
wraps the compilation commands, or in case of ccache use the symlink
trick (see man ccache). Actually what breaks it are " -quotation marks. 
It may also break if CXXFLAGS or CFLAGS are multi-words enclosed in
"-quotation marks.

The safest bet is to use the following compiler flags:

CC=gcc
CXX=g++
CFLAGS=-O2
CXXFLAGS=-O2

* The following warning can be ignored: 

 config.status: WARNING:  /home/(...)/llvm-gcc4-2.0/Makefile.in seems to ignore the --datarootdir setting
