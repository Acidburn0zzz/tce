Building and installation
=========================

It is recommend you install the tce-llvm-gcc to the same prefix you installed
the TCE in. The following uses the 'tce-config' script to figure out the
prefix of TCE.

Ensure that the script is found by executing the following command:

    tce-config --prefix

In case the result is empty, you should add TCE's bin directory to your 
PATH environment variable before continuing.

Next, build and install the tce-llvm-gcc as follows:

	autoreconf
	mkdir build && cd build
	../configure --prefix=$(tce-config --prefix)
	make && make install

Library and tools version prerequisites
=======================================

You need 'flex' or 'bison'. They should be found in all Linux distributions.

LLVM-TCE on 64-bit distributions
================================
If you compile LLVM 2.1 from sources you should give --enable-pic option for
the LLVM's configure script. Otherwise compilation of LLVM-TCE might fail.
