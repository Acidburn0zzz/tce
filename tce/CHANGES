1.4 not yet released
====================

Notable new features
--------------------
- Support for LLVM 2.9.
  LLVM 2.7 and 2.8 unsupported but might still work, see below for known 
  problems.  We strongly recommend upgrading to LLVM 2.9.
- OpenCL Embedded compliant FPU implementations by Timo Viitanen / TUT
- Generic VHDL implementations for the basic streaming operations
  from Jani Boutellier / University of Oulu.
- ConnectionSweeper IC network exploration algorithm.
  Optimizes the IC network by sweeping the buses of the machine and 
  removing the least important connections first until a cycle count
  worsening threshold is reached. Tries to remove RF connections 
  first as they are usually more expensive than the bypass connections.
- Added --pareto_set switch to the explorer for printing pareto efficient
  configurations. Currently supports the connectivity and cycle count as
  the quality metrics.

Code generator improvements
---------------------------
- Passes the first function parameter in register instead of stack.
- Uses negative guard more aggressively, less stupid guard xoring operations.
- Emulation pattern generation improved, can use immediates directly when
  using DAG to emulate missing operations.
- Some other minor pattern improvements leading to slightly better code
  on some situations.
- Alias analysis improvements, understands that register spills to stack
  cannot alias with other memory operations

Optimizations
-------------
- tcecc: Decreased scheduling time.
- tcecc: Decreased memory usage.
- ttasim: Compiled simulation (-q) can correctly simulate machines with
  guard latency higher than 1. Simulating such machines no longer makes 
  the simulator revert to interpreting mode.

Usability features
------------------
- tcecc: Reasonable error message if disk space runs out during TPEF writing.
- ttasim: Refuses to simulate a program that moves a too wide immediate to 
  a too narrow jump/PC port in the control unit. It would result in wrong
  execution as it jumps to a clipped address.
- ProDe: Scroll position is kept when zooming.
- ttasim: In case of memory access alignment error, prints the address.
- explore: the explorer can now reuse old architectures in the
  design space database (DSDB). Thus it's possible to speed up resumed
  explorations by using the DSDB from the previous exploration to
  get cycle counts from the DSDB instead of a new compile&simulation.
- Improved error handling caused by broken operation DAGs. Now sometimes
  gives reasonable error message instead of cryptic error message or crash
  when operation DAG has some error.

Bugfixes
--------
- ProDe: Shows the machine which is being edited immediately also with
  WxWidgets 2.8
- ProDe: When some editing command is cancelled, and nothing is changed, 
  the machine is not marked as modified so ProDe does not want to save it.
- ProDe: Copying FU from one machine to another no longer causes
  prode to crash. The address space of FU copied from one machine to
  another is left unset.
- ProDe: No longer asks the filename again when editing a adf file in
  current directory and saving it.
- ttasim: when the last instruction executed was a jump and the
  simulation was killed (reseted), the jump was executed in the 
  new simulation.
- ProGe: Some FUs had unnecessary 'SHIFTW' parameters in the default HDB
  causing broken top level VHDL to be generated. Fixed by Jani Boutellier of 
  University of Oulu.
- tcecc: Some missing patterns could cause internal compiler error while compiling.
- Missing operation behaviour file could cause simulator or osal tester to 
  fail. Now warning message is given and the .opp without corresponding .opb
  is ignored, if behaviour source file is found. If source file not found,
  the module is still loaded(assumes all operation xecuted via dag code)
- Trying to load machine which used same socket as source for multiple 
  register reads (either reads same register, or moves are guarded and
  always exclusive moves) might cause the simulation to hang.
- When a machine was fully RF connected but not fully connected
  (direct busses from all RF's to FU's and FU's to RF's, but all
  buses were not connected to all sockets) some registers were never used.
- If machine has SUBF operation but no NEGF operation, compiler could
  fail to compile code for the machine.
- Default OSEd.conf which may be broken on some machine no longer comes
  with TCE. This file is now autogenerated when OSEd is ran for first
  time, and the autogeneration should create a working one.

Documentation
-------------
- Documented the use of OperationDAGs to describe operation semantics.
- Added example of using ConnectionSweeper and pareto_vis to visualize
  connectivity-wise interesting architectures.
- A tutorial on using the hardware FPUs provided by TCE.

Misc
----
- llvm-gcc support deprecated. Only Clang will work correctly with LLVM 2.9
  and TCE 1.4. llvm-gcc might still work with LLVM 2.7 and LLVM 2.8,
  but is unsupported.
- ABI change: Alignment rules for some data types changes when using
  LLVM 2.9. This means that old .o and .bc files have to be regenerated when 
  upgrading TCE from using llvm 2.7 or llvm 2.8 into llvm 2.9.

Known problems
--------------
No known problems with LLVM 2.9 and Clang. See below for the known 
problems in TCE 1.3 if you have to use an older LLVM for some reason.

1.3    November 2010
====================

Notable new features
--------------------
- Support for LLVM 2.8 (support for LLVM 2.7 retained)
- ttasim: call info (setting profile_transfer_tracking) and the instruction
  profile (ttasim setting profile_data_saving) are now saved to separate
  pure text files to speed up simulation when these traces are enabled.
- ttasim: instruction profile can be converted to cachegrind-compatible 
  traces which can be visualized with kcachegrind.
- SystemC integration: Possibility to add TTA simulation models to system
  level simulations with the ability to override the operation pipeline 
  simulation models for the function units.
- Improved the scheduling for unconnected machines through temporary
  register copies based on the maze algorithm for ASIC place & route.
  Not restricted to maximum of two copies anymore.
- Basic support for debugging info when compiled with 'tcecc -g'. 
  The source code line numbers are displayed as comments in 'tcedisasm' 
  output and ttasim's disassembly.
- Platform Integration support is improved. New integrator components
  include AvalonIntegrator which can be used to integrate TTA to a
  Altera SOPC Builder component and KoskiIntegrator which can be used
  to integrate TTA processor to Koski toolset compatible IP blocks with
  IP-XACT 1.2 component description file.

Code generator improvements
---------------------------
- New register assignment strategy that avoids reuse of registers to
  produce more ILP for the post-pass scheduler.
- Improved code generation for comparisons of boolean values.
- Avoids putting immediate value into register with some comparisons,
  more often passes the immediate directly to the comparison operation.

Usability features
------------------
- ProDe: when copying a load-store unit (FU), also copies the address 
  space parameter.

Bugfixes
--------
- tcecc: stdout/stderr redirection was broken for running subcommands
  and caused occasional false failures.
- tcecc: sometimes generated incorrect code when there was a jump to 
  llvm select instruction (usually c/c++ ?-operator).
- ttasim: In compiling mode value written to memory sometimes appeared
  to load operations triggered at same cycle. Those should read
  the old value from the memory.

Optimizations
-------------
- ttasim: destruction was extremely slow after simulating large
  programs due to extremely slow destructor of InstructionMemory
- tcecc: Decreased scheduling time.

Misc
----
- ttasim: removed support for simulating the experimental 'sequential
  TTA programs'. Sequential a.out programs was the intermediate representation 
  from the old (now unsupported) gcc 2.7.0 compiler frontend.

Known problems
--------------
- LLVM 2.8 has a bug which may cause incorrectly compiled programs when
  the is a comparison of (only) lowest bits of integers in the code 
  being compiled.
  A patch for this bug is included in TCE release, it should be applied
  to the LLVM source tree and LLVM recompiled and reinstalled with the patch.
  LLVM 2.7 might also be affected, but we have not seen the bug appear with
  LLVM 2.7.
- Clang has a bug related to code generation of bitfields, illegal
  code may be generated if the code contains bitfield and clang is used 
  as C frontend (which is the default). This bug appears with libmad.
  See http://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=8171 for the bug report.
  
1.2    June 2010
================

New features
------------
- Support for LLVM 2.7 (dropped support for LLVM 2.6)
- Proper support for Clang. Clang now the default compiler frontend
  in tcecc.
- Preliminary support for automated platform integration. 
  First supported platform is the Stratix II DSP board.
- Added parameter --no-fp-emu to tcecc. This parameter disables 
  linking any floating point emulation code. It can be used to
  make the compiled program smaller in the case the dead code 
  elimination fails to remove unused FP code.
- Added parameter --conservative-pre-ra-scheduler which leads to 
  faster schedule with machines with low amount of registers but usually
  decreases performance with machines with lots of registers.

Bugfixes
--------
- sqrt() calls are now correctly converted to SQRTF operations
  only in case the operation is supported by the ADF, otherwise
  to emulation function calls.
- tcecc: compilation warnings and errors are now always output to
  stderr unbuffered (used to output only in case of compilation error)
- Data alignment rules of data types fixed to be same in backend
  and frontend. 
- Compiled simulation does not handle long guard latencies,
  implemented fallback to the interpreted engine when simulating 
  machines which have long guard latencies.
- Multi-bit registers can no longer be used as boolean registers by the 
  compiler; support for them was buggy and using them could cause incorrectly
  scheduled programs. Now every machine has to have at least 2 one-bit
  registers which are used for guards(predicates) and boolean values.

1.1 unreleased
==============

This version was never released as tar balls, but can be only 
checked out from the version control system.

New features
------------
- Support for LLVM 2.6 (dropped support for LLVM 2.5)
- Sign extension operations are not required anymore.
- Program Image Generator supports MIF-format (Memory
  Initialization File) used by Altera.
- ttasim-tandem: a tool for comparing the two simulation engines
  to assist in tracking simulation bugs.
- Operation code numbering guideline changed. Operation codes should be
  numbered according to the their alphabetical order. HDBEditor and ProGe
  issue a warning message if this convention is violated.
- tcecc: added a switch for setting the llvm-gcc optimization level
- Program Image Generator supports writing binary image to vhdl package
- Program Image Generator has (experimental) support for COE image files
- a helper script 'minimize-ic' for invoking the SimpleICOptimizer
  explorer plugin
- support for using the Clang as the C frontend via 'tcecc --clang'.
  NOTE: Clang 1.0 (released with LLVM 2.6) needs to be patched with
  tools/patches/clang-1.0-tce-support.patch for the TCE support.
- Utility programs to test that OSAL behaviour definitions and HDL
  implementations of function units are equal.
  - testhdb command line tool to test FU and RF implementations in HDB
  - ttaunittester to test the FUs and RFs implementations defined in IDF
- ProDe: when copying a bus, also copy its guards
- PIG now automatically copies memory images to ${proge-output}/tb directory
  if image type is ascii and -x flag is given.

Code optimizations
------------------
- Decreased scheduling time for big programs. 
  Unfortunately compiling time increased for small programs.
- Smarter heuristics for selecting which bus and FU to use, leads to
  programs which use fever connections, allowing more of them to be
  removed.
- Eliminates some stupid register to itself moves.

Bugfixes
--------
- rand() might now return something else than 0
- Scheduler could fail on machines with different short immediate widths
  and only some busses guarded.
- Random scheduler failures when software bypassing.
- Operations with state on machines with trigger bound to operand which is
  not last operand could be scheduled incorrectly.
- SimpleICOptimizer explorer plugin could remove connections that were used,
  resulting a machine where the code does not work.
- Instruction fetcher failed to fetch correct instruction when global lock
  signal was asserted.
- Better support for selecting custom ops with DAG definition.
- Having not operation on the machine caused incorrectly compiled programs.
- Better error handling for stale .opb files.
- Boost should not warn anymore about deprecated hash_set with gcc 4.3.
- Having lots of parallelism and easily analyzable memory addresses could
  cause incorrectly compiled programs.
- ttasim -q: could fail if some result is never read.
- ttasim -q: fixed wrong simulation of instructions with predicate moves
  and the same predicate written at the same cycle
- Simulator could fail to load some programs.
- Memory leak fixes.
- Toplevel busy signal now locks the core properly.
- Compiled simulator failed to simulate custom memory writing operations
  correctly.
- FU outputs are now updated when the compiled simulation is stopped to
  make the machine state correct for inspection.
- Avoids placing data at address 0 because it is indistinguishable from NULL.
- Operand type initialized correctly in osed operand editing dialog.
- Direct memory accesses to global tables could get wrong address.
- ProDe: segments cannot be selected anymore (selects the bus always instead),
  an irritating long standing bug.
- Proxim: crashed when unable the load the program due to missing
  operation simulation models.
- Missing .opb file no longer causes ttasim to go to forever loop,
  now exits with a meaningful error message.
- LIMM write to IU works if glock is issued on the same cycle
