1.0-beta1     2008-10-02
========================

New features
------------

- Upgraded the compiler to use LLVM 2.3 (support for LLVM 2.2 dropped).
- Added support for FU resource conflict detection to the compiled
  simulator engine.
- Implemented processor utilization stats to the compiled simulator
  engine.
- Added 'clocked' attribute to the operation definitions that depend
  on the processor clock signal (mainly real time clocks etc.).
- Added example stream operations to the base opset and documented them in
  the TCE User Manual's tutorial section.
- Constant support for the OSAL DAG language.
- Added support for dynamic compiled simulation. Static compiled simulation
  is still used by default.
- Fixed TCE to compile and pass tests with Ubuntu 6.06 LTS (Dapper).
- Lots of work on automatic and manual design space exploration tools.
- New sequential scheduler which minimizes scheduling time and helps
  to isolate compilation bugs between LLVM and TCE. 
  Invoke with 'tcecc -O0'.
- SimpleICOptimizer Explorer plugin now has a switch to preserve the minimal
  opset.
- Evaluate Explorer plugin added to easily evaluate configurations.
- MinimalOpSet Explorer plugin added to check machines against the minimal
  opset.

Bug fixes
---------
- Workaround for an ICE that happened with LLVM-GCC inlining.
- Bug #14: Tcl 8.5 has a problem with stack size detection which caused Proxim's
  script interpreter to fail (see Bug #14). Removed support for Tcl 8.5 for
  now. Use Tcl 8.0-8.4 until Tcl 8.5 has fixed this issue properly.
- Bug #35: add explicit casts to the OSAL operand types in the _TCE_*()
  macros generated by tceopgen
- Fixed a bug when generating code for guarded jumps in compiled
  simulator.
- Determinism fixes to the instruction scheduler.  
- Optimized scheduling of long immediates. Speeds up scheduling up to
  50% for some cases.
- Got rid of compile warnings on Ubuntu 8.10 (Intrepid Ibex).
