1.2    June 2010
================
New features
------------
- Support for LLVM 2.7 (dropped support for LLVM 2.6)
- Proper support for Clang. Clang now the default frontend compiler
  in tcecc.

Bugfixes
--------
- sqrt() calls are now correctly converted to SQRTF operations
  only in case the operation is supported by the ADF, otherwise
  to emulation function calls.
- tcecc: compilation warnings and errors are now always output to
  stderr unbuffered (used to output only in case of compilation error)
- Data alignment rules of data types fixed to be same in backend
  and frontend. 
- Compiling simulator does not handle long guard latencies well,
  implemented fallback to intepreted engine when simulating machines which 
  have long guard latencies.
- Global tables from floating point emulation do not get into the data image 
  if the floating point emulation functions are not needed.

1.1 unreleased
==============

This version was never released as tar balls, but can be checked out
from the version control system.

New features
------------
- Support for LLVM 2.6 (dropped support for LLVM 2.5)
- Sign extension operations are not required anymore.
- Program Image Generator supports MIF-format (Memory
  Initialization File) used by Altera.
- ttasim-tandem: a tool for comparing the two simulation engines
  to assist in tracking simulation bugs.
- Operation code numbering guideline changed. Operation codes should be
  numbered according to the their alphabetical order. HDBEditor and ProGe
  issue a warning message if this convention is violated.
- tcecc: added a switch for setting the llvm-gcc optimization level
- Program Image Generator supports writing binary image to vhdl package
- Program Image Generator has (experimental) support for COE image files
- a helper script 'minimize-ic' for invoking the SimpleICOptimizer
  explorer plugin
- support for using the Clang as the C frontend via 'tcecc --clang'.
  NOTE: Clang 1.0 (released with LLVM 2.6) needs to be patched with
  tools/patches/clang-1.0-tce-support.patch for the TCE support.
- Utility programs to test that OSAL behaviour definitions and HDL
  implementations of function units are equal.
  - testhdb command line tool to test FU and RF implementations in HDB
  - ttaunittester to test the FUs and RFs implementations defined in IDF
- ProDe: when copying a bus, also copy its guards
- PIG now automatically copies memory images to ${proge-output}/tb directory
  if image type is ascii and -x flag is given.

Code optimizations
------------------
- Decreased scheduling time for big programs. 
  Unfortunately compiling time increased for small programs.
- Smarter heuristics for selecting which bus and FU to use, leads to
  programs which use fever connections, allowing more of them to be
  removed.
- Eliminates some stupid register to itself moves.

Bugfixes
--------
- rand() might now return something else than 0
- Scheduler could fail on machines with different short immediate widths
  and only some busses guarded.
- Random scheduler failures when software bypassing.
- Operations with state on machines with trigger bound to operand which is
  not last operand could be scheduled incorrectly.
- SimpleICOptimizer explorer plugin could remove connections that were used,
  resulting a machine where the code does not work.
- Instruction fetcher failed to fetch correct instruction when global lock
  signal was asserted.
- Better support for selecting custom ops with DAG definition.
- Having not operation on the machine caused incorrectly compiled programs.
- Better error handling for stale .opb files.
- Boost should not warn anymore about deprecated hash_set with gcc 4.3.
- Having lots of parallelism and easily analyzable memory addresses could
  cause incorrectly compiled programs.
- ttasim -q: could fail if some result is never read.
- ttasim -q: fixed wrong simulation of instructions with predicate moves
  and the same predicate written at the same cycle
- Simulator could fail to load some programs.
- Memory leak fixes.
- Toplevel busy signal now locks the core properly.
- Compiled simulator failed to simulate custom memory writing operations
  correctly.
- FU outputs are now updated when the compiled simulation is stopped to
  make the machine state correct for inspection.
- Avoids placing data at address 0 because it is indistinguishable from NULL.
- Operand type initialized correctly in osed operand editing dialog.
- Direct memory accesses to global tables could get wrong address.
- ProDe: segments cannot be selected anymore (selects the bus always instead),
  an irritating long standing bug.
- Proxim: crashed when unable the load the program due to missing
  operation simulation models.
- Missing .opb file no longer causes ttasim to go to forever loop,
  now exits with a meaningful error message.
- LIMM write to IU works if glock is issued on the same cycle
  
1.0 first public release, 2009-03-26
====================================

New features
------------
- Support for LLVM 2.5 (dropped support for LLVM 2.4).

Code optimizations
--------------------------
- Decreased scheduling time

Code generator improvements
----------------------------
- Creates slightly faster emulation code for comparion operations 
  which are missing from the machine.
- Improved schedule for reduced connectivity machines.

Bug fixes
---------
- Compiling simulator simulated some dag-specified operations incorrectly
  and sometimes failed to generate code to some.
- Fixed a bug which caused random scheduler failures.

1.0-beta2     2008-11-13
========================

New features
------------
- Support for LLVM 2.4 (dropped support for LLVM 2.3).
- Explorer can now print available plugins with "-g" option switch.
- Explorer can now print plugin parameters with "-p <plugin name>" switch.
- Simulator's x (dump memory) command can now dump memory to a binary file
  with switch /f
- Added --unroll-threshold switch to tcecc to control the aggressiveness
  of the loop unrolling.

Code optimizations
------------------
- Optimized the time spent in loading of program to the simulator.
- Optimized the time to write program to tpef file.
- Scheduling big programs should be much faster.
- Scheduler memory usage should be less

Bug fixes
---------
- Fixed a bug which caused random scheduler failures.
- Dropped support for Boost 1.32 as it has some bad bugs, at least 1.33 required
- ProDe: crash when "fully connecting" unconnected RF ports fixed. 
- The compiler backend plugins now contain the TCE version string in
  the file name to avoid problems with incompatible backend versions
  in TCE version upgrades.
- custom operation sometimes got reordered illegally.

Documentation
-------------
- Added proper documentation on marking the state properties of
  operations sharing the same state (side-effects, affected-by, affects)
  to the user manual.

1.0-beta1     2008-10-02
========================

New features
------------

- Upgraded the compiler to use LLVM 2.3 (support for LLVM 2.2 dropped).
- Added support for FU resource conflict detection to the compiled
  simulator engine.
- Implemented processor utilization stats to the compiled simulator
  engine.
- Added 'clocked' attribute to the operation definitions that depend
  on the processor clock signal (mainly real time clocks etc.).
- Added example stream operations to the base opset and documented them in
  the TCE User Manual's tutorial section.
- Constant support for the OSAL DAG language.
- Added support for dynamic compiled simulation. Static compiled simulation
  is still used by default.
- Fixed TCE to compile and pass tests with Ubuntu 6.06 LTS (Dapper).
- Lots of work on automatic and manual design space exploration tools.
- New sequential scheduler which minimizes scheduling time and helps
  to isolate compilation bugs between LLVM and TCE. 
  Invoke with 'tcecc -O0'.
- SimpleICOptimizer Explorer plugin now has a switch to preserve the minimal
  opset.
- Evaluate Explorer plugin added to easily evaluate configurations.
- MinimalOpSet Explorer plugin added to check machines against the minimal
  opset.

Bug fixes
---------
- Workaround for an ICE that happened with LLVM-GCC inlining.
- Bug #14: Tcl 8.5 has a problem with stack size detection which caused Proxim's
  script interpreter to fail (see Bug #14). Removed support for Tcl 8.5 for
  now. Use Tcl 8.0-8.4 until Tcl 8.5 has fixed this issue properly.
- Bug #35: add explicit casts to the OSAL operand types in the _TCE_*()
  macros generated by tceopgen
- Fixed a bug when generating code for guarded jumps in compiled
  simulator.
- Determinism fixes to the instruction scheduler.  
- Optimized scheduling of long immediates. Speeds up scheduling up to
  50% for some cases.
- Got rid of compile warnings on Ubuntu 8.10 (Intrepid Ibex).

1.0-alpha1    2008-05-06
========================

The first preview release for co-op universities and companies.
