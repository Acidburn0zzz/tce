1.0-beta1     2008-xx-xx

New features
------------

- Added example stream operations to the base opset and documented them in
  the TCE User Manual's tutorial section.
- Constant support for the OSAL DAG language.
- Added support for dynamic compiled simulation. Static compiled simulation
  is still used by default.
- Fixed TCE to compile and pass tests with Ubuntu 6.06 LTS (Dapper).

Bug fixes
---------
- Workaround for an ICE that happened with LLVM-GCC inlining.
- Bug #14: Tcl 8.5 has a problem with stack size detection which caused Proxim's
  script interpreter to fail (see Bug #14). Removed support for Tcl 8.5 for
  now. Use Tcl 8.0-8.4 until Tcl 8.5 has fixed this issue properly.
- Bug #35: add explicit casts to the OSAL operand types in the _TCE_*()
  macros generated by tceopgen
