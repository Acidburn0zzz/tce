About autotools
===============

Motivation for the use of autotools is to ease the maintanence of Makefiles 
as well as to ease the building and installation the project on the many 
different platforms.

configure.ac is configuration file placed in the root directory of the project.
configure.ac checks for certain things, eg. C++ compiler, header files, or
functions. Based on these checkings a header file named config.h is generated.
config.h can then be included in source code files where it is needed.
configure.ac is given as a input to autoconf, which generates configure 
script that can then be executed.

Makefile.am is an input file for automake. Usually every project directory
contains its own Makefile.am. In Makefile.am you can specify what programs
you want to build. You can place there also regular Makefile rules if
necessary.

Usage
=====

Every time you have edited one of the Makefile.am's or configure.ac, you need 
to update generated files (configure, Makefile.in's). The easiest way to do
that is to go to the root directory of the project and type

autoreconf -v        (-v prints a little information)

To generate Makefile's and config.h, you need to type

./configure

Then you can build everything just by typing

make
