Building and installation
=========================

Building and installation with the help of autotools should be very easy. 
First, to create Makefiles you have to run configure as follows:

	./configure --prefix=INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY

If you don't give prefix, the software will be installed in /usr/local/.
In that case you have to install TCE as root. 

Be sure to set CXXFLAGS environment variable to include aggressive 
optimization flags (e.g., "export CXXFLAGS=-O3") before running 
the configure script. This results in much more efficient TCE toolset, 
most notably the simulator is often more than 10x faster when compiled 
with aggressive compiler flags.

After running configure, it should be enough to just type

make
make install

Building the development version
================================

The development version does not ship with a pregenerated 'configure' script.
In order to build the development version, one needs to generate the
configure script by running 'autoreconf' in the TCE root directory.
Autoreconf is part of autotools, thus you need to install packages 
'automake1.9' and 'autoconf'.

Experimental Python bindings
============================

The distribution contains experimental Python bindings for some of the
TCE libraries. The bindings are not built by default, you have to give
the "--enable-python" flag to ./configure.

The bindings require the Boost.Python library and the Python
development headers and libraries. On Debian based Linux distributions
installing the libboost-python-dev package should be sufficient.

Library and tools version prerequisites
=======================================

These are the current prerequisites for libraries and tools used by TCE:

Compiler              minimum version
-----------------     ----------------
GCC                   3.2.2 
or
Intel C++ Compiler    8.0

Library               minimum version                      library licence
-----------------     ----------------                     ---------------
Xerces                2.3.0                                Apache v2.0
wxWidgets             2.6.0                                wxWidgets
Tcl                   8.0                                  BSD-style
Boost                 1.32.0                               very permissive
sqlite3               3.0.0 (v2 not supported)             public domain

optional:

Editline              2.9                                  BSD-style

	To get line editing capabilities to the command line interface of the simulator.

	You can download the sources here: http://www.thrysoee.dk/editline/

	Note: this library might require 'termcap' library in some distributions. 
	The package is named 'libedit-dev' in Debian and Ubuntu.

Python                2.4                                  very permissive

	The Python interpreter and its headers and libraries are
	needed for the optional Python bindings.

The development files of the following Boost libraries are required by TCE:
. regexp,
. spirit,
. filesystem,
. format,
. graph,
. tuple,
. python  (optional, required for the Python bindings).

Some distributions, like Fedora Core, include all Boost libraries in a 
single package, but some, like Debian and Ubuntu, have separated them in 
several packages. 

Remember to install the '-dev' versions of the packages in order to get
the library headers which are need to compile client code against them.
You also need a version of "GNU Make" to build TCE.

For example, to install the required libraries and tools for Ubuntu 6.06 
using its package manager 'apt-get', you need to execute the following command
as root: 

apt-get install libwxgtk2.6-dev libboost-{filesystem,graph,regex}-dev \
                tcl8.0-dev libedit-dev libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 \
                libxerces27-dev g++ make latex2html

Officially supported Linux distributions
========================================

TCE is compiled and tested automatically in several Linux distribution 
environments on every week day. These distributions are 'officially
supported distributions' which are guaranteed to carry majority of 
packages required by TCE and also pass automated tests. Some distributions
may require installing packages not found in distribution's official
repositories.

The environments are as follows.

Debian Sid on Pentium 3
Debian Etch on AMD Athlon 1GHz
Debian Etch on HP-PA

Semi-supported Linux distributions
==================================

These distributions are used by developers or active users of TCE, but 
might not be included in the "compiletest farm" which compiles and tests 
TCE automatically.
