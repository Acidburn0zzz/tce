This file lists solutions to common troubles people have with 
compilation and installation of TCE.

configure does not find wxWidgets library
-----------------------------------------

If you are sure that you have all wxWidgets headers and libraries installed
(you can verify this by using wx-config), and configure is still unable to
find it, the problem might be caused by gcc 4.0 and strict compiler flags.

For example, when one has defined 'CXXFLAGS=-ansi -Wall -pedantic', the
configure test that test compiles a small wxWidgets test program fails
because of errors found in wxWidgets headers. A workaround to this is to
add '-Wno-long-long' to the CXXFLAGS. This makes the compiler skip errors
reported of usage of 'long long', which causes the compilation to fail.

Manuals and specification documents are not built
-------------------------------------------------

Make sure you have installed the transfig package and latex2html.
