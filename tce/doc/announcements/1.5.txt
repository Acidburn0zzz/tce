--------------------------------------------------

Acknowledgements
----------------
Thanks to Tomasz Czajkowski of Altera for ensuring the TCE project 
is allowed to use VHDL wrappers for certain Altera IP blocks in 
the Platform Integrator. This made the Altera FPGA support more robust.

Many thanks to Herv√© Yviquel and Vinogradov Vyacheslav who submitted their
first TCE patches to this release. Keep them coming!
