TTA-based Co-design Environment (TCE) v1.8 released
---------------------------------------------------

TTA-based Co-design Environment (TCE) is a toolset for designing 
application-specific processors based on the Transport Triggered 
Architecture (TTA). The toolset provides a complete retargetable co-design
flow from high-level language programs down to synthesizable processor
RTL (VHDL and Verilog backends supported) and parallel program binaries.
Processor customization points include the register files, function units, 
supported operations, and the interconnection network.

...

Note: this time we decided not to do a tar ball release. The users 
are directed to check out the release branch from the version control 
system. The branch might get fixes backported after the release
announcement.
