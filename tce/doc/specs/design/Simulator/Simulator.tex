\chapter{INTRODUCTION}

\section{Purpose and Scope}

This document describes in detail the design of the modules that make up the
TTA processor simulator of the TCE toolset (Simulator).

Intended readers of this documents are primarily the developers of the
Simulator.  The level of detail level and the completeness of the design
description is sufficient to make implementation straightforward.

For a complete, implementation-level description of the API of the classes
of the Simulator the reader is referred to the automatically-generated API
reference document.

This document is based on the function specifications defined
in~\cite{SimulatorSpecs} and on the software architecture described
in~\cite{SimulatorModDesign}.

\chapter{Simulator Front-end}


\section{Overview}

The Simulator Front-end provides a general programming interface for easy
implementation of user interfaces. For example, a graphical or a text-based
user interface can be implemented on top of the Simulator Front-end.

\section{Interfaces}

\subsection{Initialisation Methods}

\begin{description}

\item[machine() : const Machine\&]%
  Returns the machine object model (MOM) currently under simulation. If
  none, returns \emph{NullMachine}. MOM cannot be changed through this
  reference.

\item[program() : const Program\&]%
  Returns the program object model (POM) currently under simulation. If
  none, returns \emph{NullProgram}. POM cannot be changed through this
  reference.

\item[loadMachine(machine : Machine\&)]%
  Sets the machine to be used in simulation. \emph{Simulator Frontend} does
  not delete \emph{machine} when simulation terminates. Deletion is a
  responsibility of the client.

\item[loadMachine(fileName : const string\&)] %
  Loads the machine object model from \emph{fileName} and uses it in the
  next simulation. \emph{Simulator Frontend} becomes the owner of the
  created \emph{Machine}. The created \emph{Machine} is deleted when the
  simulation is killed.

  Throw exception [[exception]]\note{DISCUSS:define exception type} if an old
  simulation is still running.

\item[loadProgram(program : Program\&)] %
  Sets the program to be simulated. \emph{Simulator Frontend} does not
  delete \emph{program} when simulation is terminated. Deletion is a
  responsibility of the client.

  Throw exception [[exception]]\note{DISCUSS:define exception type} if an old
  simulation is still running.

\item[loadProgram(fileName : const string\&)] %
  Loads the program object model using a TPEF with \emph{fileName} and uses
  it in the next simulation. \emph{Simulator Frontend} becomes the owner of
  the created \emph{Program}. The created \emph{Program} is deleted when the
  simulation is killed.

  Throw exception [[exception]]\note{DISCUSS:define exception type} if an old
  simulation is still running.
\end{description}

\subsection{Access to Machine and Machine State Model}

The Simulator Frontend provides a uniform interface for gain access of the
state of any visible processor resource. The front end identifies and refers
to state objects by a name strings. State objects for different type of
processor components are differentiated by the syntax of the string. The TCE
Architecture Template Programming Interface~\cite{TCE-progTemplate} fully
describes the syntax.


\begin{description}
\item[findRegisterByName(registerName : const string\&) : SimValue\&] %
  Return the contents of the register identified by \emph{registerName}.
  This method parses the input string and tries to interpret it as name of
  a register or port of the target processor architecture. It then looks up
  and returns the contents of the object that represents the state of the
  register in Machine State Model (see Chapter~\ref{ch:msm}).
\end{description}

\section{Implementation}

\subsection{Simulation Profile Data Base}
\label{ssec:impl-prof}

\paragraph{Profile Section Construction}
The Simulator Frontend does not rely on TPEF API directly. The construction
of a ProfileSection is hidden in a mini-module.  If construction of the
ProfileSection from a Profile object is implemented directly inside the
function (which seems reasonable), then the mini-module simply invokes the
appropriate constructor:
\begin{verbatim}
  ProfileSection(Profile aSimProfile)
\end{verbatim}

\paragraph{Implementation requirements of execution count type}
The primitive execution count type must retain, as much as possible, the
precision of integer type: it must be that
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:exec-count}
  (\textrm{count} + 1) - \textrm{count} = 1
\end{equation}

Moreover, the range of the execution count must be larger than the range of
integer types.  This condition rules out the usual 32-bit type, whereas
condition (\ref{eq:exec-count}) rules out the single-precision floating
point type.

Two possibilities are to be discussed: using double-precision floating point
type, which allows integer precision for a number up to $2^{53}$, assuming a
53-bit mantissa,%
\footnote{The double-precision 64-bit floating-point IEEE-754 type has a
  53-bit mantissa.}
%
or, using a customized abstract type based on 32-bit integer (with
possibility to expand to a more bits if the range limit is exceeded).


\section{Error Handling}


\chapter{Simulator Controller}
\label{ch:sim-con}

\section{Overview}

The Simulator Controller controls the simulation running in stand-alone
mode. It owns and is the main client of the Machine State Model. When the
TCE Simulator is connected to a system level simulator, the Simulator
Controller probably is replaced with an adapter that implements the
interface expected by the system level simulator.

\section{Interfaces}

\subsection{High-Level Simulation Control}

\begin{description}
\item[step(int count)] %
  Advance simulation by \emph{count} clock cycles.  If \emph{count} is
  omitted, advance simulation by one cycle.  The Simulator Controller module
  simulates the specified amount of cycles and then returns control to the
  client.  The number of program instructions simulated may be smaller than
  \emph{count} if the lock signal is activated (or already active).
\item[run()] %
  Advance simulation until either simulation terminates or a condition for
  stopping is enabled.  Stopping conditions are handled by function
  \verb|prepareToStop()|.
\item[prepareToStop()] %
  Get ready to return control to the client.  This method tells the
  Simulator Controller that simulation must stop as soon as the cycle
  currently being simulated is completed.
\end{description}

A simplified sequence diagram of a simulation clock cycle is shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:msm_simple_simucycle}.

\begin{figure}[tb]
\centerline{\psfig{figure=eps/MSM_simplified_cycle.eps,width=1.0\textwidth}}
\caption{A Simulation Cycle (simplified).}
\label{fig:msm_simple_simucycle}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Locking}

There are two types of locks depending on the cause of the lock: internal
and external locks. An internal global lock is active when a function unit
cannot deliver its result in time or when the unit that implements the
operation cannot accept a new trigger move. An external global lock
originates from a request of an external module.

\subsubsection{GlobalLock}
\label{sec:msm_GlobalLock}

Class \emph{GlobalLock} represents a lock signal. The Simulator Controller
owns an instance of this class, which models the global lock signal of the
target processor.

Simulator Controller sets the lock to false before notifying each
\emph{FUState} object of clock advancement. Any \emph{FUState} instance can
raise the lock signal if needed.

The following interface is provided for handling the lock.
\begin{description}
\item[lock()]%
  Raise the global lock signal of the processor core.
\item[unlock()]%
  Lower the global lock signal of the processor core.
\item[isLocked()]%
  Returns `true' if the processor core is locked, `false' otherwise.
\end{description}

Simply locking or unlocking the processor at any request is not possible
without precautions, see Section~\ref{ssec:multi-locks} for details.
\note{PENDING: \ref{ch:pending:exo-locks}}

\section{Implementation}

This section describes implementation problems that require non-trivial
solutions.

\subsection{Offline Preprocessing of Program}

The Simulation Controller is responsible for simulating TTA instructions.
To avoid the run time overhead of finding the state objects (port, bus, or
register states) the individual moves of the program accesses, \emph{Move}
objects of the Program Object Model~\cite{POM-design} are converted into
\emph{ExecutableMove} objects.

\emph{ExecutableInstruction} owns and controls the \emph{ExecutableMove}
instances of a TTA instruction. In turn, \emph{ExecutableInstruction}
objects are controlled and accessed by the Simulation Controller using a
container class \emph{InstructionMemory}.

An \emph{ExecutableMove} instance refers to Machine State Model objects.
The source and destination components and the bus assigned to the move are
translated into their corresponding state object before starting simulation.

In practice, \emph{ExecutableMove} contains pointers to Machine State Model
higher abstractions (see Section~\ref{sec:msm-principles})
\emph{ReadableState} (the source of the move), and \emph{WritableState} (the
destinations of the move). Additionally, \emph{ExecutableMove} contains a
state object that represents the state of the bus that transports the data.
This \emph{BusState} object (see Section~\ref{sec:bus-state}) is both
readable and writable.

\subsection{ExecutableMove}

\emph{ExecutableMove} represents an interpreted move. It contains direct
pointers to the source and destination state components, and to the bus
that is programmed by the move.

In case the source of a move is an in-line immediate, it is modelled by an
instance of class \emph{InlineImmediateValue}. This simple class implements
the \emph{ReadableState} interface by always returning the value it was
initialized with.

\begin{description}

\item[ExecutableMove(src : const ReadableState\&, bus : StateData\&, dst :
  WritableState\&)]%
  Constructor for unguarded moves (that is, with an ``always true'' guard).
  The move reads the contents of \emph{src} and copies it into \emph{dst}
  using \emph{bus} as transport means.

\item[ExecutableMove(..., guardReg : SimValue\&, negated : bool)] %
  Constructor for guarded moves. In addition to the arguments for the
  unguarded move constructor, denoted by ``\ldots'', this constructor
  requires a guard register \emph{guardReg} and a flag \emph{negated}. The
  created move executes only if \emph{guardReg} is not zero. If flag
  \emph{negated} is `true', then the condition is reversed, and the move
  executes only if the \emph{guardReg} is zero.

\item[executeRead()] %
  Copies the value on the move source to the transport bus.

\item[executeWrite()]%
  Copies the value on the bus to the move destination.

  If the move is guarded, the guard expression is tested before copying the
  data on the bus to the destination. When the guard evaluates to false, the
  move is ``squashed'' and this function returns without affecting the
  machine state.

  Note that the data is always written to the bus, even if the guard
  expression evaluates to false. This is an arbitrary model that, depending
  on the hardware implementation and the timing, may not reflect the actual
  activity taking place on the target processor.
\end{description}

\subsection{ExecutableInstruction}
\label{ssec:exec-ins}

This class represents an interpreted TTA instruction. Its responsibility is
to direct simulation of the \emph{ExecutableMove} and the
\emph{LongImmUpdateAction} objects it owns. Class
\emph{ExecutableInstruction} and its associations are illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:msm_ExecutableInstrAndMove}.

Instructions may contain the bits of long immediates and specify the
destination registers for the immediates. A long immediate register can be
read by moves of the same or following instructions.
%
Long immediate value update actions are a set of \emph{LongImmUpdateAction}
objects. Each update action contains a \emph{SimValue} (the contents of the
immediate encoded in the instruction) and a reference to the destination
register, \emph{LongImmediateRegisterState}.

\begin{figure}[tb]
\centerline{\psfig{figure=eps/MSM_exec_instr_and_move.eps,width=0.5\textwidth}}
\caption{ExecutableInstruction and ExecutableMove.}
\label{fig:msm_ExecutableInstrAndMove}
\end{figure}

Class \emph{ExecutableInstruction} implements the following interface:
\begin{description}
\item[execute()]%
  Before executing any moves, the long immediate values are updated by
  copying the value of long immediate (the \emph{SimValue}) to the target
  long immediate register (the \emph{LongImmediateRegisterState*}) by
  calling the \verb|execute()| method of \emph{LongImmUpdateAction}.

  After updating the state of the immediate registers, \verb|executeRead()|
  of each \emph{ExecutableMove} in the instruction is called, and finally
  \verb|executeWrite()| of each \emph{ExecutableMove} is called.
\end{description}

\subsection{InstructionMemory}

\emph{InstructionMemory} is a container of \emph{ExecutableInstructions}.

\begin{description}
\item[instructionAt(address : IntWord) : ExecutableInstruction\&] %
  Returns a reference to instruction at given address.
\end{description}

\subsection{SimProgramBuilder}

This builder class creates an object hierarchy that represents a TTA
program and is specialised for fast simulation.

The source data that models a TTA program is an instance of class
\emph{Program}, the root class of the Program Object Model.

The object hierarchy built by class \emph{SimProgramBuilder} is a flat list
of preprocessed TTA instructions, \emph{ExecutableInstructions} (see
Section~\ref{ins}).


\begin{description}
\item[build(prog : const Program\&, locator : const StateLocator\&) :
  InstructionMemory*]%
  Build and return a model of the instruction memory ready to be simulated,
  loaded with preprocessed TTA instructions from program \emph{prog}. The
  state locator \emph{locator} generated by \emph{MachineStateBuilder} (see
  Section~\ref{sec:ms-builder}) is used to find the machine state components
  referenced by POM objects.

  The client owns and is responsible for deallocation of the constructed
  InstructionMemory.

  Throws \emph{IllegalProgram} exception if an error occurs while
  preprocessing \emph{prog}. Errors my occur, for example, when the program
  contains references to components that have state, but whose state is not
  found by the given locator.

\end{description}

\subsection{How Locks Are Generated}
\label{ssec:lock-generation}

Data transports are emulated sequentially, thus an internal global lock will
generally occur half-way during the execution of current
instruction.\note{PENDING: \ref{ch:pending:locks}}

\subsection{Simulation Overhead Due to Lock Support}
\label{ssec:lock-state}

Locking conditions are a concern only when simulating operations with
dynamic latencies or external modules that communicate with the TTA
processor. When simulation is run from a stand-alone application and uses no
operations with dynamic latency, internal locks cannot occur and overhead of
preparing for lock conditions should be minimized.

\subsection{Locked State Activity}

When lock signal is risen, the controller does not advance the program
counter in following cycles until the signal is lowered again. Pipeline
models that support operations with dynamic latencies, however, need to
receive the notifications that the clock advances to next cycle, because
they may have to receive results of pending operations. In general, Function
units should always receive the clock signal and let their own pipeline
model decide how to handle it.

In fact, when the lock condition is caused by a result not being ready from
an operation, the pipeline that contains that operation \emph{must} test for
the pending result until it comes, because that is the only way the
processor can unlock.

\subsection{Multiple Locks}
\label{ssec:multi-locks}

When the simulator enters the locked state due to a result not ready, there
can be several result moves causing a lock simultaneously. Thus, several
independent lock requests can occur internally. Once processor is locked,
pipelines do not advance (they can only update pending results), and so no
new lock condition can be generated inside the processor core in following
cycle. Every cycle in locked state, the pipelines that caused the lock will
check for late-coming results and will confirm the lock condition until the
result has been delivered. When all pipelines that caused a lock have their
result delivered, the lock condition will simply not be set by any pipeline,
and the processor simulation will proceed to next instruction.

\chapter{Machine State Model}
\label{ch:msm}

\section{Overview}

Machine State Model (MSM) is an object hierarchy that represents the visible
state of the target TTA processor (the ``machine'') at any given simulation
cycle. Just enough information to correctly simulate the program needs to be
stored. MSM is implemented as application-specific object library. No domain
module is aware of MSM.

\section{Design Principles}
\label{sec:msm-principles}

\begin{enumerate}
\item%
  The MSM partially mirrors the Machine Object Model (MOM)~\cite{MOM-design}
  object hierarchy, but it does not depend on MOM. Each instance of a
  Machine State Model class depends only on the properties of the
  corresponding MOM object.  These properties are necessary during
  construction and are passed as independent parameters.
  %
  For example, \emph{BusState} does not need to own the list of supported
  guard expressions, but only the bit width and the extension type of the
  MOM \emph{Bus} object.

\item%
  The requirements of MSM do not affect or create dependencies to it in the
  Program Object Model~\cite{POM-design} or MOM, which are fundamental
  domain object hierarchies and should remain independent of specific client
  needs. For example, there is no method in MOM components to retrieve the
  state of the component.

\item%
  The only goal of Machine State Model is to support a fast simulator. To
  simplify and speed up simulation, only the state of (sub)components that
  is needed for correct simulation is modelled by a MSM state object. For
  example, sockets don't have state, because the values on a socket can be
  tracked cycle by cycle by combining information about bus state and source
  or destination port of each move.

  Any detail of the processor that cannot be accessed by a TTA program does
  not have to be modelled. For example, it is not necessary (and in general,
  not even possible) to know what values are stored in the internal stages
  of an operation pipeline.

\item%
  Each state class of Machine State Model can be readable, writable or
  clocked. A state class with one or more of these properties implements the
  following interface (pure virtual) classes:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item%
    \emph{ReadableState}: the state object can be read.
  \item%
    \emph{WritableState}: the state object can be written.
  \item%
    \emph{ClockedState}: the state object is notified whenever the clock
    advances.
  \end{enumerate}
  This high level abstraction of machine components simplifies access to
  state during simulation.

\item%
  State objects should be independent from each other as much as possible.
  Motivations for this are reusability, design simplicity. Moreover, if
  states of components are not cross-related by ADF specs, this should be
  reflected in MSM, too. For example, a function unit does not know whether
  other function units have requested an access to the same memory location.

  This rules out features like:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item%
    Hierarchical clock notification, in which bus state components notify
    all connected sockets which in turn notify all connected input function
    unit ports of clock advances.
  \item%
    Writing a value to a bus automatically triggers the destination input
    port of the unit connected to it.
  \end{enumerate}

\item%
  State objects offer just basic interface to modify or inspect the values
  they contain. No high-level ``intelligence'' needed by a processor
  simulator is implemented in MSM objects. It is responsibility of the
  Simulator Controller (see Chapter~\ref{ch:sim-con}) to model the control
  and activity that occurs while simulating the processor core.
\end{enumerate}

\section{WritableState}

When a class of MSM models a piece of machine state that can be modified by
clients, it must implement this interface. It provides a method to change
the state data.
\begin{description}
\item[setValue(value: SimValue) : void]
\end{description}

\section{ReadableState}

When a class of MSM models a piece of machine state that can be inspected by
clients, it must implement this interface. It provides a method to inspect
the state data.
\begin{description}
\item[value() : const SimValue\&]
\end{description}

\section{StateData}

The \emph{StateData} interface combines \emph{WritableState} and
\emph{ReadableState} interfaces. Each accessible object of MSM intended to
model state that is visible to clients usually implements this interface.

Even if a component is logically read-only from the point of view of some
clients, it needs to be writable by some other clients, or vice versa. For
example, the input ports of a function unit should be written only by
objects of client class \emph{ExecutableMove}, but the values of the ports
need to be read by the \emph{FUState} when an operation is triggered.  In
addition, a client with debugging capabilities should be able to change and
inspect the value of any state object in the model.

\section{ClockedState}

\emph{ClockedState} is the interface implemented by state classes that need
to update their internal state whenever elapsing of a processor clock cycle
is simulated. \emph{ClockedState} provides the following interface for
implementing the simulation activity.

\begin{description}
\item[endClock() : void] %
  Perform activity supposed to occur by the end of current clock cycle. At
  this point all transports described in the current instruction are
  guaranteed to be done.

\item[advanceClock() : void] %
  Perform activity supposed to occur in a clock cycle change. When this
  method is called, it's guaranteed that the clock of memory models are
  advanced, that is, memory has been notified that all requests of current
  cycle have been sent.
\end{description}

\subsection{Motivation for Two-Phase Clock Simulation}

The \emph{ClockedState} interface cannot present a simple interface based on
a single method, \verb|advanceClock()|. Cycle-accurate simulation of target
TTA processors requires that, as a clock cycle elapses, the machine state is
updated in (at least) two phases.

The reason why the single method is not adequate lies in the
cross-dependency between the processor core and the memory models.
%
In particular, the functions that model the behaviour of operations that
access memory must work with any kind of underlying memory model (described
in Memory Model Design Document~\cite{MemoryModuleDesign}) and operation
implementations. This includes memory operations with latency of one cycle,
for which the following TTA code is valid:
\begin{verbatim}
 0: ADDRESS -> ldw.1
 1: ldw.2 -> r1
\end{verbatim}
To be able to support these operations, the implementation of the memory
model must return any result of an access request in any given cycle before
the next clock cycle, when it could be already used.

OSAL behavior language~\cite{OSAL-specs} implementation for a load operation
that works for this kind of memory could be something like this:
\begin{verbatim}
OPERATION(LDW)

TRIGGER
    INITIATE_READ(INT(1), WWIDTH);
    MEM_DATA(INT(2));
    RETURN_READY;
END_TRIGGER;

END_OPERATION(LDW);
\end{verbatim}

The operation's trigger simulation function initiates the read request, and
immediately stores the result into the output `2'.

This is fine if the underlying memory model is capable of delivering results
after one cycle, because we are sure that the result is correctly stored by
macro \verb|MEM_DATA| into output `2'.  But, if the latency is higher, this
operation behaviour definition does not work anymore, because the result is
not ready. Since we cannot make assumptions about the memory model
implementation, we cannot expect that the results from memory are available
immediately. For this reason, to maintain generality, the results from
memory must be returned by a late-result simulation function, as in the
following operation definition:
\begin{verbatim}
OPERATION(LDW)

TRIGGER
    INITIATE_READ(INT(1), WWIDTH);
    RETURN_NOT_READY;
END_TRIGGER;

LATE_RESULT
    MEM_DATA(INT(2));
    RETURN_UPDATED;
END_LATE_RESULT;

END_OPERATION(LDW);
\end{verbatim}

This operation definition works with any memory model implementation, but it
is not sufficient if the \emph{ClockedState} interface provides only method
\verb|advanceClock()|. It still does not work when the latency of memory
operations is one cycle. In that case, the single method invocation can only
initiate the memory access request. The requests affect memory only when
memory is notified, with \verb|advanceClock()|, that all requests of current
cycle have been simulated. Only after the memory model is notified the
access requests the results from memory can be computed. So, the result will
be available only at the end of the next simulation cycle, during following
invocation of method \verb|advanceClock()|. Too late for a possible use of
the result.

The chosen solution to this problem is to add another method,
\verb|endClock()| to \emph{ClockedState}. This method must be implemented by
clients that must model the activity occurring after all data transports of
current cycle have been simulated and before clock cycle is elapsed.
Clients (such as \emph{OperationExecutor}, described in
Section~\ref{sec:operation-executor}) can now proceed with any effects of
the transports that are to be modelled before other clients are notified of
clock cycle end. For example, \emph{OperationExecutor} can simulate
triggering of a new operation. In case of memory operations,
\emph{OperationExecutor} will send the memory requests of the current
instruction to the memory model. The results from memory are read in
\emph{OperationExecutor} implementation of method \verb|advanceClock()|,
after the memory model is notified about the clock change by the same
method.
%
\note{Warning: ugly sequential constraint between conceptually independent
  invocations to same base interface method.}
%
This sequence works also for 1-cycle memory operations if
\verb|lateResult()| is called within \verb|advanceClock()| for the
operations triggered within method \verb|endClock()| of the same clock
cycle.

\section{MachineState}

\emph{MachineState} is the root class of the machine state model, shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:msm_MachineState}, and owns all the state objects.  Also, it
provides methods for retrieving individual state objects. State objects are
indexed by their name.

\begin{description}
\item[MachineState()]%
  Constructor. Create an empty machine state root object, that contains no
  state objects.

\item[clone(ms : const MachineState\&)]%
  Make this machine state an exact copy of the given machine state object,
  \emph{ms}.

  Throw [[exception]] \note{DISCUSS: exception type} if this machine state
  is not empty.

\item[GCUState() : GCUState\&]%
  Return the global control unit state of this machine state model.

\item[busState(name : string) : BusState\&]%
  Return the \emph{BusState} with the given name, if found. Returns
  \emph{NullBusState} if not found.

\item[FUState(name : string) : FUState\&]%
  Return the \emph{FUState} with the given name, if found. Returns
  \emph{NullFUState} if not found.

\item[portState(name : string) : PortState\&]%
  Return the \emph{PortState} with the given name, if found. Returns
  \emph{NullPortState} if not found.

\item[registerFileState(name : string) : RegisterFileState\&]%
  Return the \emph{RegisterFileState} with the given name, if found.
  Returns \emph{NullRegisterFileState} if not found.

\item[longImmediateUnitState(name : string) : LongImmediateUnitState\&]%
  Return the \emph{LongImmediateUnitState} with the given name, if found.
  Returns \emph{NullLongImmediateUnitState} if not found.

\end{description}

For construction, \emph{MachineState} provides methods (not listed in the
method list below) for adding the different types of machine state objects
to the model.

\begin{figure}[tb]
\centerline{\psfig{figure=eps/MSM_machine_state.eps,width=0.7\textwidth}}
\caption{\emph{MachineState} and its relations with \emph{FUState}
  subclasses.}
\label{fig:msm_MachineState}
\end{figure}

\section{MachineStateBuilder}
\label{sec:ms-builder}

Although this class is not part of the Machine State Model, but rather an
external helper class that provides the connection between Machine Object
Model, it's described here for convenience.
%
\emph{MachineStateBuilder} is responsible for creating the machine state
object hierarchy corresponding to a given input \emph{Machine}. This class
provides only build methods and has no state: each invocation of its methods
creates a new machine state object hierarchy from scratch.

While building the state object hierarchy, \emph{MachineStateBuilder}
creates and maintains an index table for quick lookup of the state object
corresponding to a given MOM object.
%
\emph{MachineStateBuilder} can return the index table to any client along
with the built \emph{MachineState} instance.

\begin{description}
\item[MachineStateBuilder()] %
  Empty constructor.

\item[build(machine : const Machine\&, memSys : const MemorySystem\&)
  : MachineState*] %
  Create and return a machine state built from the given \emph{Machine}
  instance and the given description of the memory system, \emph{memSym}
  (see Section~\ref{ms-memsys} for details on class \emph{MemorySystem}).
  The created \emph{MachineState} instance becomes property of the client
  and should be deleted after use.

\item[build(machine : const Machine\&, memSys : const MemorySystem\&,
  locator : StateLocator\&) : MachineState*] %
  In addition to creating and returning the machine state like previous
  method, return the index table (\emph{locator}). The client should supply
  a (possibly empty) \emph{StateLocator}, which is initialised as the
  building process progresses.
\end{description}

\subsection{StateLocator}

The index table used during construction of the machine state model is
implemented by a helper class called \emph{StateLocator}. A new instance of
\emph{StateLocator} is created whenever a new machine state is created.

The locator that makes it possible to lookup state objects of a machine
state corresponding to the \emph{Component} instances of the \emph{Machine}
object used as data source to build the parent \emph{MachineState} of the
state objects.

The locator returns references to state objects of one particular
\emph{MachineState} instance, but the same processor can have several
different states, represented by as many \emph{MachineState} object
hierarchies. It must be possible to have a locator for each instance of
\emph{MachineState}.

\emph{StateLocator} provides following methods:

\begin{description}
\item[state(momComponent : const Component\&) : StateData\&] %
  Return the state object corresponding to the given component of the
  machine object model.

  Throws exception
%
  \note{\emph{IllegalParameter} subtype of exception?}
%
  if the given component (1) is unregistered; (2) does not belong to the
  parent machine of the components stored in the locator; (3) is a component
  for which no corresponding state object exists (for example, \emph{Socket}
  objects); (4) is a component for which the corresponding state object has
  not been created (yet).

\item[copy(newLocator : StateLocator\&, m : const MachineState\&)]%
  Copy the contents of this state locator into locator \emph{newLocator},
  and redirect all references to state object to the equivalent state object
  in the given machine state, \emph{m}. Two state objects owned by different
  \emph{MachineState} instances are equivalent when they have the same name
  and the same type.
\end{description}

\section{RegisterFileState}
\label{sec:msm_RegisterFileState}

\emph{RegisterFileState} is a simple container of \emph{RegisterState}
objects. Register file state objects do not need to model the state of RF
ports, because the state is the same of the transport bus that carries the
data read from or written into the port, and the port involved (when
multiple ports are available) can found by inspecting the source and
destination socket of the move that reads or writes the register file.

Class \emph{RegisterFileState} is needed only during preprocessing of POM
moves into \emph{ExecutableMove} instances. The preprocessed moves used by
the Simulation Controller access single \emph{RegisterState} objects (seen
as \emph{ReadableState}) directly, not through class
\emph{RegisterFileState}.

The class diagram of \emph{RegisterFileState} and related classes is shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:msm_regfilestate}.

\begin{figure}[tb]
\centerline{\psfig{figure=eps/MSM_rfstate.eps,width=0.4\textwidth}}
\caption{RegisterFileState.}
\label{fig:msm_regfilestate}
\end{figure}

\begin{description}
\item[RegisterFileState(size : int)] %
  Creates a register file state object for \emph{size} registers. Registers
  are modelled by class \emph{RegisterState} (see
  Section~\ref{sec:msm_RegisterState}) and are created during construction.

\item[register(index : int) : RegisterState\&] %
  Returns a \emph{RegisterState} object representing the state of a register
  at position \emph{index} in the register file.

  Throws \emph{OutOfRange} exception if the given index is greater than the
  register file size.
\end{description}


\subsection{UnboundedRegisterFileState}

This class is a specialisation of \emph{RegisterFileState} whereby the size
of the register file is not bounded. Its purpose is to model the infinite
set of variables (treated as ``virtual registers'') that may be used in
unscheduled TTA code (see the TCE Architecture Template Programming
Interface~\cite{TCE-progTemplate} for details).

The main difference between \emph{UnboundedRegisterFileState} and its base
class is the way \emph{RegisterState} objects are constructed. Creation of
\emph{RegisterState} objects happens only ``on demand'', whenever a register
at a given index is requested by method \verb|register()| for the first
time.
%
\note{PENDING: \ref{ch:pending:unbounded-rf}}

The only difference in \emph{UnboundedRegisterFileState} lies in
constructor, which does not accept a size parameter:

\begin{description}
\item[UnboundedRegisterFileState()] %
  Creates a register file state object. Registers are modelled by class
  \emph{RegisterState} (see Section~\ref{sec:msm_RegisterState}).
\end{description}

\section{RegisterState}
\label{sec:msm_RegisterState}

The \emph{RegisterState} class represents the contents of a register of the
target TTA processor as a \emph{SimValue}. It implements the
\emph{StateData} interface:

\begin{description}
\item[setValue(val : SimValue) : void]%
  Copies the value given by parameter \emph{val} into the register.
\item[value() : const SimValue\&]%
  Returns a reference to the contents of the register (a \emph{SimValue}
  instance).
\end{description}

\subsection{Implementation}

\paragraph{Simplification of the register state model.}
If the state of the GPR's were to be modelled realistically,
\emph{RegisterState} should implement the \emph{ClockedState} interface. Its
contents would get updated only upon invocation of \verb|advanceClock()|. To
make the register state model simpler and more efficient,
\emph{RegisterState} is updated immediately, in \verb|setValue()|.

The implication of this simplification is that updating GPR state does not
occur synchronously, and the state of \emph{RegisterState} objects may not
reflect the actual machine state. The rest of the machine state model should
be prepared for this.
%
For example, writing to a register by a move of an instruction in hardware
means writing to a port of an register file. The register inside the
register file gets updated in the rising clock edge. In MSM, a
simplification is done for the sake of efficiency: the value is written
directly to the correct register inside the register file. MSM works
correctly if clients first read all registers that must be read in a cycle
and then perform all write accesses. This is acceptable because in reality
moves first write their values to the bus and only after that the values are
written from the buses to the target ports.

In case moves were simulated by writing directly the value at the source
port into the destination port, a register connected to the source port
could get overwritten before being read by another move in the same
instruction. This situation occurs whenever an instruction contains moves
that read and write the same register.

The lack of a synchronous model of GPR state also implies that register
files with latency are not supported. As they are not supported in
ADF~\cite{ADF-specs} either, it's safe to do this kind of optimization. In
future, if register files with latency will be supported, the implementation
of \emph{RegisterFileState} will become more similar to that of the
\emph{LongImmediateUnitState}, described in
Section~\ref{sec:LongImmediateUnitState-if}.

\section{LongImmediateUnitState}
\label{sec:LongImmediateUnitState-if}

This class represents the state of immediate units of a target TTA
processor. Like for register files (see
Section~\ref{sec:msm_RegisterFileState}), the ports of immediate units are
not modelled. It is not necessary to model which instruction template (or
other encoding mechanism) is used to write long immediate registers, because
this information can be obtained from the program object model.
%
\emph{LongImmediateUnitState} is essentially a container of long immediate
registers and provides a method for accessing the registers.  Unlike
\emph{RegisterFileState}, this class implements the \emph{ClockedState}
interface, thus it provides a synchronous model of immediate units. This is
a necessity, because long immediate register updates can have a latency
greater than one cycle.

The class diagram of \emph{LongImmediateUnitState} and related classes is
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:msm_immunitstate}.

\begin{figure}[tb]
\centerline{\psfig{figure=eps/MSM_immunit_state.eps,width=0.5\textwidth}}
\caption{LongImmediateUnitState.}
\label{fig:msm_immunitstate}
\end{figure}

\begin{description}
\item[registerValue(index : int) : SimValue]%
  Returns the current contents of the long immediate register at position
  given by argument \emph{index}.
\item[setRegisterValue(index : int, value : SimValue)]%
  Copies \emph{value} into the long immediate register at position given by
  argument \emph{index}.
\end{description}


\subsection{Implementation}

\paragraph{Immediate unit state controls its immediate registers.}
The need to model latency affects how update and access of register contents
is implemented. Register contents is updated always through the public
interface of \emph{LongImmediateUnitState} class, in which the data is
actually stored, not directly to the independent register classes like in
\emph{RegisterFileState}.
%
\note{DISCUSS: inconsistent with RF interface, unnecessary (long imm
  register could delegate their parent instead)}

\paragraph{Implementation of long immediate unit latency}
Internally, new values written into immediate registers are placed in a
queue. The contents of the registers is actually updated with the values in
the queue only after a number of clock cycles equal to the immediate unit
latency has elapsed. Value queues are updated when \verb|advanceClock()| is
invoked.

\section{LongImmediateRegisterState}

Class \emph{LongImmediateRegisterState} represents a register of a long
immediate unit. Instances of \emph{LongImmediateRegisterState} are always
owned by a long immediate unit, implemented by class
\emph{LongImmediateUnitState} (see
Section~\ref{sec:LongImmediateUnitState-if}).

Long immediate registers implement the \emph{StateData} interface, like
general purpose registers. Unlike \emph{RegisterState} class,
\emph{LongImmediateRegisterState} performs extension the value stored into
the register using method \verb|setValue()|.

\begin{description}
\item[setValue(value: SimValue) : void] %
  Copies the value given by parameter \emph{val} into the register.

\item[value() : const SimValue\&] %
  Returns a reference to the contents of the register (a \emph{SimValue}
  instance).
\end{description}

\subsection{Implementation}

Unlike general purpose register state objects, class
\emph{LongImmediateRegisterState} does not hold the contents of the
register.  Instead, it refers to its actual contents (modeled as a
\emph{SimValue}) by means of an index and a reference to the parent
\emph{LongImmediateUnitState}, and delegates any access request to the
parent. In particular, \verb|setValue()| calls method
\verb|setRegisterValue()| of the parent \emph{LongImmediateUnitState}, and
\verb|value()| calls \verb|registerValue()|.

\section{BusState}
\label{sec:bus-state}

\emph{BusState} is implemented as \emph{RegisterState} (described in
Section~\ref{sec:msm_RegisterState}). The main difference is that
\emph{BusState} takes into account the extension mode of the transport bus
and models extension whenever a value with bit width smaller than the bus
bit width is stored into the bus.

\section{BridgeState}
\label{sec:bridge-state}

Bridges can be sources of moves. Bridge state is modelled by class
\emph{RegisterState}.

\section{FUState}
\label{sec:msm_FUState}

Class \emph{FUState} models the state of a function unit of a target TTA
processor. The class diagram in Figure~\ref{fig:msm_FUState} shows
\emph{FUState} and the main classes related to it.

\begin{figure}[tb]
\centerline{\psfig{figure=eps/MSM_FUState.eps,width=0.8\textwidth}}
\caption{FUState.}
\label{fig:msm_FUState}
\end{figure}

Function unit state is by far the most complex type of state object of MSM.
An important distinction has to be made between two parts of function unit
state:
\begin{enumerate}
\item State directly managed by the function unit objects.
\item State managed by operations.
\end{enumerate}

Function unit state is modelled in the same way for all function units of
the target processor and is completely managed inside class \emph{FUState}.

Operation-managed state is modelled by means of special operation state
classes defined in OSAL~\cite{OSAL-specs}. Each class is specific for a
group of operations that share the same state data. Class \emph{FUState} is
client of such operation-managed state classes, but does not need to know
anything specific about the state data (it is all hidden inside the
functions that model operation behaviour).

Operation-specific state is ``private'' information shared between function
unit state objects and OSAL behaviour model of operations. There is no
public method of function unit state class for inspecting operation-specific
state information.

\emph{FUState} implements the \emph{ClockedState} interface and provides
methods for changing its internal state. These methods, listed below, are
used mainly by input port classes \emph{TriggeringInputPortState},
\emph{OpcodeSettingVirtualInputPortState} to notify the owning function unit
state object that a transport to the unit through them has occurred.

\begin{description}
\item[FUState(name : string)]%
  Constructor. Create a function unit state object with given name.  The
  object just created does not contain any port or operation executors.

\item[addOperationExecutor(opExec : OperationExecutor, op : Operation\&)] %
  Add operation executor \emph{opExec} to this function unit state and
  register it for modelling execution of operation \emph{op}.
%
  If given operation has been already registered to another operation
  executor,
%
  \note{DISCUSS: throw exception instead?}
%
  simply update it to \emph{opExec}.

\item[addPort(fuPort : PortState\&)] %
  Add given function unit port state to this function unit state.

\item[setTriggered()] %
  Notify the unit that an operation has been triggered in current simulation
  cycle.

\item[setOperation(operation : Operation\&)] %
  Update the current operation being performed by the function unit to
  \emph{operation}. This is the operation that will be performed as soon as
  the unit is triggered.

  Throw [[exception]] \note{IllegalParameter exception type?} if no
  operation executor for given operation is registered.
\end{description}

\subsection{Implementation of ClockedState}

\begin{description}
\item[endClock() : void] %
  Inform the unit that all possible transports to its input ports for
  current cycle have been simulated. The unit can now safely read the new
  values written into its input ports and possibly trigger a new operation
  as a result.

  If a new operation was triggered in the current cycle, the input port
  values are passed to \emph{OperationExecutor} of the appropriate operation
  by invoking method \verb|startOperation()|.

\item[advanceClock() : void] %
  Call \verb|advanceClock()| of the \emph{OperationExecutor} and reset the
  triggered status flag (if it was set).
\end{description}

\subsection{MemoryAccessingFUState}

A special type of function unit state class, \emph{MemoryAccessingFUState},
models function units that access memory.  It's shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:msm_MachineState}.

Unlike \emph{FUState}, this class holds a reference to a memory interface
(\emph{MemoryWrapper}) which is passed to the \emph{OperationContext} of the
unit.

\emph{MemoryAccessingFUState} instances check whether the state (in this
case memory) is available in their \verb|advanceClock()| implementation. If
OSAL's \verb|isAvailable()| returns false, the global lock is enabled by
calling the \emph{GlobalLock} instance's \verb|set()| method.

\subsection{Implementation}

\paragraph{Managing operation-specific state.}

\emph{FUState} manages operation-specific state without depending on
type-specific information of the objects, and performs the following
operations:
\begin{enumerate}
\item%
  Delegate creation of operation-specific state objects within an operation
  context to operations (OSAL behaviour model).
\item%
  Keep operation-specific objects (indirectly, via operation context) for
  later references.
\item%
  Pass operation-specific state objects as arguments of operation behaviour
  methods (indirectly, via operation context).
\item%
  Manage destruction (when deallocating operation context).
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Binding of operation inputs and outputs to ports.}

The binding information in \emph{OperationExecutor} is a duplicate of
information stored in MOM \emph{FunctionUnit}. This information is needed,
internally, to retrieve the input values and store them in the input stage
of operation executor. The order of input values must be correct, in order
to make operation behaviour methods work correctly.

The only need for accessing binding information directly from MSM objects is
method \verb|loadState()| of \emph{OperationExecutor}, to reconstruct the
contents of the queue of pending operations.

\paragraph{Managing Operation Executors}

Operation Executors are passed to \emph{FUState} by value. Both client and
\emph{FUState} receiver remain responsible of their own copy of the
operation executor.

Before being registered to a parent \emph{FUState}, an operation executor
does not contain direct references to port state objects. Such references
would represent indirect references to the parent \emph{FUState} of the port
state objects, which can be potentially conflicting references.

\emph{FUState} may optimise the use of \emph{OperationExecutor} instances,
and use the same instance for several operations.

\note{DISCUSS}
%
If the \emph{OperationExecutor} instance passed to an \emph{FUState} belongs
to another \emph{FUState} instance, \emph{FUState} invalidates the
references to the other parent unit state and port states, and tries to
lookup port state objects with the same name among the ports it owns.

\note{PENDING: \ref{ch:pending:binding-cache}}

\section{PortState}

This class models ports of function units. Port state is treated as register
state during simulation, thus it is derived (or typedef'd) from
\emph{RegisterState}.

\section{InputPortState}

This class models the input ports of function units. Each \emph{FUState}
object owns the input ports through which new data are sent to it. The
operand values of operations are stored in input port state objects and read
by the function unit when it starts to simulate a new operation.

A special type of input port sets also the next operation that will be
performed by the unit. Another type of input port causes the function unit
to update its state (that is, triggers a new operation), whenever a value is
written into it.
%
To avoid the overhead due to functionality that a type of ports does not
have to provide, each special type of port is a refinement of
\emph{InputPortState}. The base class \emph{InputPortState} models normal
ports which do not trigger nor set the next operation to perform. The
\emph{InputPortState} subclasses that model special types of input ports are
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:msm_InputPortState}.

\begin{figure}[tb]
\centerline{\psfig{figure=eps/MSM_input_port_states.eps,width=0.7\textwidth}}
\caption{InputPortState and its subclasses.}
\label{fig:msm_InputPortState}
\end{figure}

\subsection{TriggeringInputPortState}

In addition to setting the contents of an function unit input port, method
\verb|setValue()| of this class calls method \verb|setTriggered()| of its
parent function unit.

\subsection{OpcodeSettingVirtualInputPortState}

In addition to setting the contents of an function unit input port, method
\verb|setValue()| of this class calls method \verb|setNextOperation()| of
its parent function unit.

Each operation supported by a function unit requires a ``virtual port'',
modeled by class \emph{OpcodeSettingVirtualInputPortState}. A virtual port
is associated to an operation at construction time. Whenever a new value is
written into a virtual port, it calls method \verb|setNextOperation()| of
the parent \emph{FUState} with its operation as argument.

For example, a \emph{FUState} instance which supports operations `add' and
`sub' has two \emph{OpcodeSettingInputPortState} objects, one carrying `add'
operation, one carrying `sub'. When either port is written to, the next
operation to be performed by the unit is set correspondingly.

\emph{OpcodeSettingVirtualInputPortState} does not model the real
opcode-setting port of a function unit, which is where the data of a new
input operand is actually stored. MSM models such ports as plain triggering
ports, that is, \emph{TriggeringInputPortState} instances. Every instance of
\emph{OpcodeSettingVirtualInputPortState} has a reference to the real data
port and delegates value setting and its triggering side effect to it. The
function unit and its \emph{OperationExecutor} instances read the input
operand of the opcode-setting port from the \emph{TriggeringInputPortState}
instance, not from the virtual port corresponding to the operation being
triggered.

\begin{figure}[tb]
\centerline{\psfig{figure=eps/MSM_executing_a_move.eps,width=1.0\textwidth}}
\caption{Executing a move that triggers and sets opcode.}
\label{fig:msm_exec_move}
\end{figure}

\section{OutputPortState}

\emph{OutputPortState} models an output port of a function unit. The
contents of the output ports is shared with the ``last stage'' of every
\emph{OperationExecutor} instance owned by the function unit.  When an
\emph{OperationExecutor} instance updates a value in its last stage, the
change is immediately reflected by the \emph{OutputPortState} that shares
the same value.

\section{GCUState}
\label{sec:msm_GCUState}

\emph{GCUState} is a refinement \emph{FUState} class that models the Global
Control Unit state. In addition to supporting a set of operations like other
function units, \emph{GCUState} owns and manages the special registers
\emph{Program Counter} (PC), \emph{Return Address} (RA), and the registers
used to access syscall emulation functionality: \emph{Syscall Number
  Register} (SNR) and \emph{Syscall Handler Address Register} (SHAR).

\emph{GCUState} differs from the general \emph{FUState} also because, in
addition to the \emph{OperationExecutor} objects that model the latency of
supported operations, it models the visible effect of the transport pipeline
of the processor.

\emph{GCUState} provides an interface for accessing the state of all its
special registers.

\begin{description}
\item[programCounter() : SimValue\&]%
  Return the contents of the PC register.
\item[returnAddress() : SimValue\&]%
  Return the contents of the RA register.
\end{description}

\subsection{Implementation}

\paragraph{Simulation of transport pipeline.}

\emph{GCUState} models the transport pipeline of a TTA processor. The
changes to the contents of special registers have a visible effect with a
delay equal to the number of transport stages. The transport pipeline stores
the special register values produced at each cycle in a FIFO. Each element
of the FIFO, in addition to the data of each special register, contains
information sufficient to determine how the state of special registers
affects the processor.

For example, when a jump operation is triggered, the new program counter
address is stored in a transport pipeline slot. The actual program counter
register, which determines the next instruction to execute, is actually
updated with the address only after the transport pipeline latency has
elapsed. The visible effect of the transport pipeline is a delayed control
flow transfer and the presence of ``delay instruction slots'', which follow
the control flow transfer, but logically occur before it.

\section{OperationExecutor}
\label{sec:operation-executor}

This pure interface class models any implementation-specific aspect (mostly,
timing and latency) of operation execution in a function unit.

In simulator, the model of operation execution can be easily changed; this
makes it possible to use faster models for operations implemented on a
simple pipeline (or no pipeline at all).

\emph{SimpleOperationExecutor} provides efficient modelling of operation
execution timing. This class works with any operation pipeline. Its sole
limitation is that it does not support operations that can have
nondeterministic latency and late-coming results.

\emph{OneCycleOperationExecutor} provides a low-overhead model of execution
timing for operations with one-cycle latency. These operations produce
results that are visible in the clock cycle following the cycle the
operation is triggered.

The class diagram in Figure~\ref{fig:msm_PipelineState} illustrates the
different \emph{OperationExecutor} implementations.

Despite its name, an operation executor does not contain any reference to
the operations it models. Whenever an executor is requested simulation of an
operation, the operation itself is specified.

\begin{figure}[tb]
\centerline{\psfig{figure=eps/MSM_PipelineState.eps,width=0.7\textwidth}}
\caption{Different OperationExecutor implemementations.}
\label{fig:msm_PipelineState}
\end{figure}

\emph{OperationExecutor} interface contains following methods:

\begin{description}
\item[OperationExecutor()]%
  Create an empty state and execution model for operations. No operation is
  defined for this model, and no binding information is created.

\item[startOperation(op : const Operation\&)]%
  Copy the operand values in appropriate port state objects (as given by the
  binding information) into the first stage of the executor and invoke
  \verb|simulateTrigger()| of operation \emph{op}, passing the operand
  values as argument.

  Implementations of this method may throw [[exception]] \note{DISCUSS:
    exception type} if the binding information of given operation is not
  compatible with the binding information of this operation executor. (For
  example, if index \emph{n} of executor is bound to an input port, whereas
  the same index is an input index of operation \emph{op}.

\item[readyValues() : vector<SimValue*>\&] %
  Return the values in the last stage of executor, which represent the ready
  results of one of the previous operations executed. The last stage of
  \emph{OperationExecutor} may share its contents with the
  \emph{OutputPortState} instances of the function unit. Thus, updating the
  last stage has an immediate, automatic visible effect on the state of the
  output ports. This method is solely provided for convenience, to let
  clients inspect the ready stage.

\item[advanceClock()] %
  Perform activity that should happen as a clock cycle elapses. When the
  processor is not globally locked, activity consists of testing for
  late-coming results of pending operations, advancing the FIFO that models
  operation timing and updating the ready stage (the visible results of the
  most recent completed operation).

\item[parent() : FUState\&] %
  Return the state of the parent \emph{FUState} object.

  Throw \emph{IllegalRegistration}
%
  \note{DISCUSS: specialised ``NotRegistered'' exception?}
%
  if the operation executor is not registered to a function unit state.

\item[addBinding(io : int, portName : const string)]%
  Bind the input or output \emph{io} of any operation that will be executed
  on this executor to a function unit port identified by name string
  \emph{portName}.

\item[addBinding(io : int, port : PortState\&)]%
  Bind the input or output \emph{io} of any operation that will be executed
  on this executor to given function unit port.

  Throw \emph{IllegalRegistration}
%
  \note{DISCUSS: exception type}
%
  exception if the parent function unit state of given port state is not the
  same state of the operation executor.
%
  Throw [[exception]]
%
  \note{DISCUSS: exception type}
%
  exception if the input or output with given index has been already bound
  to a port, or if the port has been already bound to another input or
  output.

\item[binding(io : int) : string] %
  Return the name of the FU port bound to a given operation input or output,
  \emph{io} or operation \emph{op}.

\end{description}

\subsection{SimpleOperationExecutor}

In \emph{SimpleOperationExecutor}, the timing model is implemented with a
ring buffer with fixed size determined at construction time equal to $L$,
where $L$ is the latency of the operation. The ready stage is not a slot of
the ring buffer.

A buffer slot contains all the state necessary to simulate a pending
operation. The state consists of the vector \emph{io} of inputs and outputs
of the operation, a reference to the invoked operation, and a flag telling
whether all the results of the operation are calculated or not.

An index keeps track of the buffer slot position where the state of the next
operation that will be invoked is going to be stored.

When a new operation is triggered with \verb|startOperation()|, \emph{io}
vector and the operation reference are copied to the buffer slot pointed at
by the index, and the trigger simulation function of the operation is
invoked.
%
The subsequent invocation of method \verb|advanceClock()| calls
\verb|lateResult()| method of the operation just triggered if its result is
not ready. Finally, \verb|advanceClock()| increments the index of buffer
slot for next operation by one \emph{modulo} the buffer size.

The ready stage usually shares its contents with the output ports of the
function unit. The ready stage is updated only when the oldest slot (at
position $(i + 1)$ modulo the size of the buffer, where $i$ is the current
index,) contains a valid operation. The results from the slot are then
copied to the ready stage. The ready stage is never overwritten with a slot
that does not contain a valid operation.

\subsection{OneCycleOperationExecutor}

\emph{OneCycleOperationExecutor} is an implementation of the execution model
suitable for operations with latency of one cycle. The results of the
operations are always computed and stored in the ready stage by the end of
the same simulation cycle in which the operation is triggered. In
\emph{OneCycleOperationExecutor} there is only one operation at a time.

The implementation of method \verb|startOperation()| is simple. The
operation given as parameter is triggered and the results are placed
directly into the ready stage. Like in \emph{SimpleOperationExecutor}, in
\verb|advanceClock()|, \verb|lateResult()| is called for results that cannot
be computed by the trigger simulation function.

\subsection{ComplexOperationExecutor}

This implementation of \emph{OperationExecutor} provides a model of
operation execution that fully supports effects of operations with dynamic
latencies, stalling, and the late results that come at nondeterministic
times, possibly while the processor is globally locked.

\subsection{Implementation}

\paragraph{Locking}
If during \verb|advanceClock()| an operation executor detects that the
global lock signal is enabled, the FIFO that models the timing of the
operation execution is not advanced. Simple operation executors do not do
anything at all. Complex models, instead, check for late-coming results.

\paragraph{Dynamic Latencies}

Simple operation execution models such as \emph{SimpleOperationExecutor} and
\emph{OneCycleOperationExecutor} assume that there are no operations with
dynamic latency, therefore it is perfectly sane to assume that the results
of the operation can be computed by the end of the same cycle in which the
operation is triggered. If an operation does not produce ready results,
simple execution models throw a \emph{InvalidObject}
%
\note{DISCUSS: type of exception}
%
exception with an error message that specifies which operation appears to
have dynamic latency.

\paragraph{Advancing the OperationExecutor FIFO}

The result (ready) stage is overwritten only if the second last stage of the
FIFO that models the execution timing contains a valid operation. The FIFO
is always advanced unless the global lock signal is enabled. If the second
last stage does not contain state of a valid operation, the ready stage
keeps its previous value.

Notice that, in general, the ready stage can be overwritten with the
execution state of a valid operation with results that are not ready.

\section{MemorySystem}
\label{sec:ms-memsys}

This class binds \emph{AddressSpace} instances of a MOM hierarchy to
\emph{Memory} instances. The same address space can be bound to different
\emph{Memory} objects in different \emph{MemorySystem} instances.

\begin{description}
\item[MemorySystem(machine : const Machine\&)]%
  Constructor. Create an empty memory system descriptor for the target
  processor \emph{machine}.
\item[addAddressSpace(as : const AddressSpace\&, mem : Memory\&)]%
  Bind address space \emph{as} to memory model \emph{mem}.

  Throw \emph{IllegalRegistration} if the address space does not belong to
  the target processor.

\item[memory(as : const AddressSpace\&) : Memory\&]%
  Return the memory model of address space \emph{as}.

  Throw \emph{IllegalRegistration} if the address space does not belong to
  the target processor. Throw [[exception]] \note{DISCUSS: exception type}
  if the address space is not found.
\end{description}

\section{Machine State Snapshots}

Machine state parts implement the \emph{Serializable} interface, thus the
snapshot can be taken easily with calling \verb|saveState()| of the
\emph{MachineState} which then constructs the \emph{ObjectState} tree of the
other components recursively.

The implementation of machine state snapshots implies that each machine
state object needs to have its name (from MOM) as an attribute so they can
be identified in the serialized form.

\section{Tracking}

Tracking of simulation activity can be implemented in the class
that executes the instructions, that is, the client of MSM. This basically
means \emph{SimulatorController}, \emph{ExecutableInstruction} and
\emph{ExecutableMove} classes.


\chapter{Simulation Event Handler}
\label{ch:event-handler}

\section{Overview}

Simulation Event Handler is a derived \emph{Informer} from \emph{Event
  Handler} toolkit module \cite{ToolkitDesign}. It mainly uses the
functionality of the general \emph{Event Handler}, but adds some
simulator-specific functionality. The main functionality added is
simulator-specific event codes. The event codes are provided as a public
enumeration in the derived \emph{SimulationEventHandler} class. Description
of supported event codes can be seen in the header file or in API
documentation.

\chapter{Debugging System}
\label{ch:debugging_system}

\section{Overview}

The Debugging System is a group of classes based on the Event Handler
\cite{ToolkitDesign} that makes it possible to track the state of the
simulation.

\emph{StopPointManager} handles the break points entered by the user and
makes sure that simulation is stopped at the point of the program required
by the user. There are two kinds of break points. \emph{Watch} is watching
an user-given expression script, and at the point its value changes,
simulation is stopped. \emph{BreakPoint} watches the program counter, and
the point the user-given instruction is reached, simulation is stopped.

\emph{StopReason} is a helper class that stores information about reason to
stop simulation. Instances of \emph{StopReason} are passed to Simulation
Controller whenever it is asked to stop simulation. Reasons can be then
queried from it and displayed to user in wanted format in user interfaces.

\section{StopPointManager}
\label{sec:breakpointmanager_class}

\emph{StopPointManager} is a \emph{Listener} (see EventHandler of
\cite{ToolkitDesign} that manages program break points.

StopPointManager depends on following classes.

\begin{enumerate}
\item%
  \emph{SimulationController}: to stop the simulation when a break point is
  reached.
\item%
  \emph{SimulationEventHandler}: to (un)register listeners to
  ``next-instruction'' events. When there are no break points, there is no
  need to receive ``next-instruction'' event notifications.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{StopPointManager class}

BreakpointManager class provides public interface to add, remove and disable
break points. Each new break point is given an integer index in range $[0,
2^{32}-1]$ using which the break point can be later deleted or disabled.

\paragraph{StopPointManager(simCon : const SimulationController\&, informer : SimulationEventHandler\&)}

References to classes the BreakpointManager is dependent on are passed in
construction phase.

\paragraph{add(newBreakpoint : const StopPoint\&) : UInt32}

Adds a new break point, returns integer handle for the break point.

\paragraph{delete(handle : UInt32)}

Delete a break point with handle.

Throws if no break point with given handle is found.

\paragraph{enable(handle : UInt32)}

Disables the break point identified by given handle.

Throws if no break point with given handle is found. Trying to enable a
break point that is already disabled is not considered an error.

\paragraph{disable(handle : UInt32)}

Disables the break point identified by given handle.

Throws if no break point with given handle is found. Trying to disable a
break point that is already disabled is not considered an error.

\paragraph{enableOnceAndDelete(handle : UInt32)}

Enables a break point with handle and sets it to be deleted when it's
invoked the next time. Error handling as in enable().

\paragraph{enableOnceAndDisable(handle : UInt32)}

Enables a break point with handle and sets it to be disabled when it's
invoked the next time. Error handling as in enable().

\paragraph{breakpoint(index : int) : Breakpoint}

Returns the breakpoint at position \emph{index} in the list of break points
owned by \emph{BreakpointManager}. The breakpoint returned is a copy.

Throw an \emph{OutOfRange} exception if no breakpoint with given index
exists.

\paragraph{breakpointCount() : int}

Returns the number of break points currently owned by
\emph{BreakpointManager}.

\paragraph{deleteAll()}

Deletes all break points. Should never fail.

\paragraph{enableAll()}

Enables all break points. Should never fail.

\paragraph{disableAll()}

Disables all break points. Should never fail.

\paragraph{setIgnore(handle : UInt32, count UInt32)}

Sets the breakpoint with handle to be ignored count times before triggering
the next time. If a breakpoint with handle is not found, an exception is
thrown.

\paragraph{handleEvent()}

Implements the interface inherited from \emph{Listener}.

Asks all contained and enabled \emph{StopPoints} whether they are triggered.
If there are triggered \emph{StopPoints} and if their \verb|ignoreCount()|
returns 0, then \emph{SimulationController} is instructed to stop simulation
before next instruction by calling its \verb|prepareToStop()| method. The
\emph{StopReason} object passed to simulation controller has
\verb|reasonCode()| set to `RC\_BREAKPOINT'.

\paragraph{setCondition(handle : UInt32, condition : ConditionScript)}

Sets the condition for breakpoint with \emph{handle}. If breakpoint
with \emph{handle} is not found, throws an exception.

\subsection{StopPoint class}
\label{subsec:breakpoint_class}

Represents a parent class for different breakpoint types. \emph{Watch} and
\emph{Breakpoint} are derived from this class. Used by the client to add
program break points. \emph{StopPointManager} uses them to store information
of each breakpoint.

\begin{description}
\item[isEnabled()]%
  Returns true if the breakpoint is enabled.

\item[enable()]%
  Enables the breakpoint.

\item[disable()]%
  Disables the breakpoint.

\item[condition() : ConditionScript]%
  Returns the condition for this breakpoint to be fired, that is, to actually
  stop simulation. If the breakpoint is unconditional, an empty condition
  script is returned.

  The condition is a line of interpreter script which is evaluated to figure
  out if breakpoint should be fired when the address matches the current
  program counter.

\item[setCondition(condition : const ConditionScript\&)]%
  Sets the condition of the breakpoint. The condition is a line of
  interpreter script which is evaluated to figure out if breakpoint should
  be fired when the address matches the current program counter.

\item[isConditional() : bool]%
  Returns true if the breakpoint is conditional, that is, its condition
  script is not an empty script.

  Even if the condition always evaluates to true Boolean value, it's still
  considered as a conditional breakpoint, because it might be very hard to
  detect all ``always true'' cases reliably.

\item[ignoreCount() : int]%
  Returns how many times this breakpoint should be ignored when the address
  matches the current program counter. If it returns 0, the breakpoint
  should be fired.

\item[setIgnoreCount(count : int)]%
  Sets the ignore count of this breakpoint. A null count implies that the
  breakpoint will be fired when the address matches the current program
  counter.

\item[isDisabledAfterTriggered() : bool]%
  Returns true if the breakpoint will be disabled after it's triggered next
  time.

\item[isDeletedAfterTriggered() : bool]%
  Returns true if the breakpoint will be deleted after it's triggered next
  time.

\item[setDisabledAfterTriggered(bool)]%
  Sets the property that determines whether the breakpoint will be disabled
  after being triggered next time.

\item[setDeletedAfterTriggered(bool)]%
  Sets the property that determines whether the breakpoint will be deleted
  after being triggered next time.

\item[isTriggered() : bool (virtual)]%
  This method is overridden in derived class to implement the check for
  condition to stop simulation. \emph{Watch} implements this method to check
  for the value change of its expression script, \emph{Breakpoint}
  implements this method to check for program counter.
\end{description}

\subsection{StopReason class}

Data storage class for storing a reason for simulation stop.

\begin{description}
\item[reasonCode() : ReasonCode]%
  Returns the code for this reason. The \emph{ReasonCode} is an enumeration
  type with values for each reason type like `RC\_BREAKPOINT' and
  `RC\_WATCHPOINT'. Reason codes are listed in the API documentation.

\item[reason() : string]%
  Returns the textual explanation of the stop reason. This usually adds
  specific information to the \emph{StopReason}. In case of `RC\_BREAKPOINT'
  \emph{ReasonCode} the text describes the breakpoint reached. The text is
  part of the user interface, and therefore is always retrieved from class
  \emph{SimulatorTextGenerator}.
\end{description}


\chapter{Tracking System}

The Tracking System module provides the capability of tracking memory access
and program execution and store related data (profiling). Tracking is
achieved using the Event Handler (Chapter~\ref{ch:event-handler}) and proxy
classes. Proxy classes inform the Event Handler of events transparently.
This means that an object causing the actions that trigger the events or a
tracked object do not need to know about event notifications. Proxy
``tracker'' classes also provide interface and functionality for passing
information about events.

\section{TrackedMemory}

Tracking of memory accesses due to operations of the target architecture as
defined by the Operation Set Abstraction Layer (OSAL) is achieved by
defining a proxy \emph{Memory} implementation, \emph{TrackedMemory}.
%
\note{PENDING: \ref{ch:pending:proxy-code-dupl}.}
%
OSAL uses and sees a tracked memory as if it were a normal \emph{Memory}.
\emph{TrackedMemory} just redirects the calls to its interface to the
underlying \emph{Memory} instance and informs Event Handler of the events.
This way neither OSAL nor the concrete \emph{Memory} implementation that is
being tracked know that the communication is tracked.
Figure~\ref{fig:memoryTracking} illustrates the classes, interfaces and
relations involved in memory tracking.

\begin{figure}[tb]
\centerline{\psfig{figure=eps/Memory_tracking.eps,width=0.8\textwidth}}
\caption{Mechanism for tracking memory accesses.}
\label{fig:memoryTracking}
\end{figure}

When memory tracking is disabled, OSAL will work with a plain (non-tracked)
implementation of \emph{Memory}; the communication takes place directly with
the concrete \emph{Memory} implementation instance instead of
\emph{TrackedMemory}. This way there is no performance degradation in case
tracking is not needed, because the proxy object --- and the overhead due to
its functionality --- is not involved.

Clients that are interested in memory access events probably want to know
also which memory areas were accessed and how (read/write).
\emph{TrackedMemory} provides an interface to store and access this
information.

\emph{TrackedMemory} can be implemented so that all memory accesses taking
place in a clock cycle are stored and event information is sent to Event
Handler only when the clock ``ticks''. In this way, clients can retrieve
information of all memory accesses happened in a clock cycle with single
call.

\subsection{Motivations for Tracking Memory at Subject Level}

Cases such as the coalescing of several identical memory access requests
occurring in the same cycle into a single request are a strong case in favor
of tracking event notification \emph{inside} the Memory Module itself.  Why?
Because the exact behavior of the Memory Model for a given pattern of access
requests is unknown to clients and yet it is needed to provide
cycle-accurate simulation.

A client simply cannot know whether multiple identical access requests in
the same cycle result in a single memory access.  If notification takes
place outside Memory Module, in client code, then the memory client will
perform inexact tracking.  Even if knowledge of Memory Model properties is
available to clients, notification is more expensive outside the Memory
Module.  The client must perform redundant (and expensive) analysis to
detect parallel, identical requests, and then decide, on basis of the
properties, whether to skip tracking of the second (and following)
notifications. This introduces a fair amount of code duplication.

\section{Execution Trace Database}

Execution Trace Database classes and database schema are described in
this section.

\subsection{Database Schema}
\label{ssec:tracedb_tables}

Execution Trace Database includes the following tables. The fields that must
contain a unique value across all the entries of the table are marked with
\textbf{bold} font. Optional fields are marked with \textit{italics}.

When possible, a unique data field of table entries is used as key field.
For example, in \emph{instruction\_execution} table, clock cycle field
contains a unique value in each entry, so it is a suitable key field. There
cannot be multiple different instruction executions in the same clock cycle,
but the same instruction can be executed in different clock cycles.

When no unique field is available, a special key field is used to uniquely
identify a table entry. There cannot be be multiple entries in the database
with exactly same key fields.

\subsubsection{database\_info}

This table contains meta-data of the database file. It includes the version
number of the database format and the TPEF file name that contains the
traced TTA program. This table contains only one row, created and inserted
when the database is initialized.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline
\textbf{database\_info} \\
\hline
\textbf{version : integer} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{instruction\_execution}

This table contains the sequence of instructions executed, cycle by cycle.
Each row contains the clock cycle and the address of the executed
instruction. The clock cycle numbering includes any wait cycles due to
global lock of the TTA processor.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{instruction\_execution}  & \\
\hline
\textbf{cycle : integer} & address : integer \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{instruction\_execution\_count}

This table contains the execution counts for each instruction in the
simulated program.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{instruction\_execution\_count}  & \\
\hline
\textbf{address : integer} & count : REAL \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{procedure\_address\_range}

This table contains the address ranges of procedures in the simulated program.
Its main purpose is to allow more informative profile data queries (procedure
execution times, etc.).

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{procedure\_address\_range}  & & \\
\hline
\textbf{first\_address : integer} & \textbf{last\_address : integer} & procedure\_name : TEXT \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{procedure\_transfer}

Contains information of all procedure transfers during simulation of the
program. A procedure transfer occurs when there's a control flow to another
procedure. From each transfer following information are recorded: the cycle
in which it happened, the address to which the transfer happened, and the
type of the transfer. The type is an integer coded, value 0 means that the
transfer was a procedure call (entry), value 1 means it was a return from
procedure (exit).

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{procedure\_transfer}  & & \\
\hline
\textbf{cycle : real} & address : integer & type : integer \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


\subsubsection{bus\_activity}

This table contains a cycle-accurate trace of the activity performed on each
transport bus. The \emph{cycle} field tells on which cycle the write
happened, the \emph{bus\_id} field identifies the bus. \emph{segment\_id}
identifies the segment in the bus (not supported currently).
The squash field tells whether the Boolean expression guarding this
transport evaluated to false, thus the data transfer was not delivered to
the destination. \emph{data\_as\_int} and \emph{data\_as\_double} store
the data in that bus (segment) in integer and double format, respectively.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{bus\_activity}  & & & & &\\
\hline
cycle : integer & bus\_id : string & segment : string & squash : boolean &
data\_as\_int : integer & data\_as\_double : real \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{concurrent\_register\_file\_access}

This table contains counts of different types of concurrent register file
accesses. That is, the count of times a register file was written W and read
R times in the same clock cycle.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{concurrent\_register\_file\_access}  & &  & \\
\hline
\textbf{register\_file : string} & reads : integer & writes : integer &
count : integer \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{register\_access}

This table contains counts of reads and writes to each register.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{register\_access}  & & & \\
\hline
\textbf{register\_file : string} & \textbf{register\_index : integer} & reads : real & writes : real \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


\subsubsection{fu\_operation\_triggers}

This table contains counts of operation triggers in each FU.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{fu\_operation\_triggers}  & & \\
\hline
\textbf{function\_unit : string} & operation : string & count : integer \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{bus\_write\_counts}

This table contains counts of bus writes.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{bus\_write\_counts}  &  \\
\hline
\textbf{bus : string} & writes : integer \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{socket\_write\_counts}

This table contains counts of socket writes.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{socket\_write\_counts}  &  \\
\hline
\textbf{socket : string} & writes : integer \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{totals}

This table contains name/value pairs for storing different total
values. Currently only 'cycle\_count' value is used, which is the
count of cycles simulation was executed to produce the TraceDB.

\subsection{Classes}

The classes described in this section provide an interface to the execution
trace database. These classes make it possible to add data or inspect the
execution trace.
%
note{New query methods will be added to the interface when needed.}
%
Figure~\ref{fig:msm_ExecutionTrace} shows the relations of classes that
implement the execution trace interface to the Toolkit module for handling
relational databases.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centerline{\psfig{figure=eps/TraceDB_ExecutionTrace.eps,width=0.7\textwidth}}
\caption{ExecutionTrace.}
\label{fig:msm_ExecutionTrace}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{ExecutionTrace}

\emph{ExecutionTrace} is the main class and represents the execution trace
database. Access to the execution trace database occurs through the
interface of this class. Queries return ``handle'' objects like
\emph{InstructionExecution}
(Section~\ref{sec:TraceDB_InstructionExecution}).  These handles are used to
navigate through the result set of the query.

\subsubsection{InstructionExecution}
\label{sec:TraceDB_InstructionExecution}

Class \emph{InstructionExecution} is a ``handle'' to navigate through the
list all execution cycles. This class is also used to access the actual data
pointed by the navigation.  Motivation for the combined responsibility is
simplicity as the accessed data is quite trivial.

\chapter{Command Line Interface}

The modular design of Simulator makes it possible to add various types of
user interfaces.  One such interface is the command line interface, which is
implemented in the first version of the Simulator.

\section{Overview}

Command Line Interface (CLI) module is structured in a few submodules.

LineReader is a wrapper to \emph{editline} library, a BSD-licensed
alternative to \emph{libreadline} used to read lines of input from the user.
Libeditline offers convenient keyboard shortcuts for line editing. Without
this kind of library, only limited keys would be available for line editing;
for example, the user would not be able to use the cursor keys. Readline,
which editline mimics, is a \emph{de facto} standard among GNU tools.

The interpreter abstraction layer (Interpreter) encapsulates the interpreter
library functionality and aims at providing an interface so generic that
it's easy to change the interpreter implementation, or even the scripting
language.  Changing the underlying interpreter library in Interpreter should
not affect other parts of the system.  The first version of the Simulator
supports Tcl interpreter library version~8.0 and above.

The main loop of CLI simply reads a line of input from user via the
LineReader and passes it, unchanged, to the Interpreter.  The interpreter
executes any command contained in the line and returns the results.  The
main loop prints the results. LineReader might also be called back by
the Interpreter in case some commands require feedback, for example
confirmation, from the user.

\section{LineReader}

Interface of LineReader consists of an initialization method and
\verb|readLine()| method for reading user input.

Concrete LineReaders should implement command history browsing functionality
internally and this internal command history list they use for that
functionality need not be accessed by LineReader's clients directly. If
client of LineReader wants to save the command history, it has to do it by
itself. This responsibility separation decision is motivated by the fact
that LineReader itself needs the command history for browsing it with cursor
keys and external library might need for example only the commands that were
successful. In this example case, the client saves the commands after
executing them to an internal database in case they were successful.

Figure~\ref{fig:linereader_class} summarizes the interface of LineReader.

\begin{figure}[tb]
\centerline{\psfig{figure=eps/LineReader.eps,width=1.0\textwidth}}
\caption{LineReader interface.}
\label{fig:linereader_class}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{initialize(string prompt = ``'', FILE* in = stdin, FILE* out = stdout, FILE* err = stderr)}
This method *must* be called before starting to use the LineReader.

initialize() method is included in the interface to ensure there exists a
possibility to assign the file streams the LineReader uses to other than the
standard ones. It is also possible to give an initial prompt to reader.


\paragraph{string readLine(string prompt = ``'')}

Reads a line of input from the user.

Uses \emph{prompt} as the ``input prompt''. The prompt is used for reading
only one line. Initial prompt is changed back before exiting this function.

In case class is not initialized by calling initialize(), throws an
exception.

\paragraph{char charQuestion(string question, string allowedChars, bool caseSensitive = false, char default~=~'$\backslash$0')}

Asks user a question and expects the answer to be given as a character.

With \emph{question}, a question may be entered, and \emph{allowedChars} is
a string with all possible legal input characters. In case \emph{default} is
not given, question is repeated until user gives a valid input according to
\emph{allowedChars}. If \emph{default} is given and user enters a character
not in \emph{allowedChars}, the \emph{default} is returned.

\emph{caseSensitive} flag allows switching the mode to case sensitive, in
which e.g. characters 'y' and 'Y' are considered to be different answers.

In case class is not initialized by calling initialize(), throws an
exception.


\paragraph{bool confirmation(string prompt, char default = 'n', char yesChar = 'y', char noChar = 'n')}

Shortcut method for asking confirmation from the user.

Because most of the questions asked with charQuestion() will probably be
confirmations in which answer alternatives are 'y' (yes) or 'n' (no), it's
nice to provide a shortcut method for it.

This method calls charQuestion() with the arguments and returns true if
the returned character is \emph{yesChar}.

This is the only method implemented in the parent \emph{LineReader} class
and acts as a ``template method'' which calls abstract methods implemented in
derived classes.

In case class is not initialized by calling initialize(), throws an
exception.

\subsection{Implementation}

The first implementation of LineReader is based on editline library. Later
on this libeditline implementation of LineReader class is referred to as
``Editline''. Manual pages of the library (man editline 3el) should provide
enough info to implement the functionality quite painlessly. Nevertheless, I
already noticed couple of problem spots within the library.

\paragraph{Multiple Editline Libraries}

In Debian, two different editline libraries seem to be available. One is
offered with a package name `libeditline0' and the other with `libedit2'. We
should use the latter, which provides command line history. The library in
`libeditline0' package is extremely simple and out-dated, and might not have
complete history capabilities.

\paragraph{Built-in Commands of Editline}

Editline has some built-in commands which
%
\note{TO DO: confirm preprocessing of built-in commands}
%
are processed before passing the result to the client. We should find a way
to switch these commands off, or just live with it and document this feature
in the Simulator's requirements. If we decide to live with those commands
(we might not have a choice), we must check the Simulator specs for
conflicting commands and come up with new names for them. Quickly checking,
there seems not to be too many that might be conflicting, maybe ``history''?

Listing of the built-in commands can be read in ``man editrc 5''.

\paragraph{Heavy Usage of Callback Functions}

Most Unix-libraries are written using C, and it shows in this case in heavy
usage of callback functions to provide customizable functionality. Because
of usage of callback functions for things like printing the prompt and
seeking the history, it is a little trickier to implement this class, but
only a little.

It seems that \emph{history()}, the default function that handles the
command history can be used with multiple History instances returned
by \emph{history\_init()}, therefore it causes no problems if we remember
to create an unique History instance for each Editline instance.

The prompt printing callback which should be defined for each instance of
our class. This might be done with setting the prompt printing function to
point to a member function of our Editline instance which prints the prompt
wanted. The value the prompt returning method should return is set before
calling the libeditline's \emph{el\_get()}.

\section{Interpreter}

Interpreter module consist of abstract classes \emph{ScriptInterpreter} and
\emph{CustomCommand}, interface class \emph{InterpreterContext}, and
\emph{DataObject} concrete class.  Refer to
Figure~\ref{fig:interpreter_module} for a class diagram.

\begin{figure}[tb]
\centerline{\psfig{figure=eps/interpreter.eps,width=1.0\textwidth}}
\caption{Interpreter module.}
\label{fig:interpreter_module}
\end{figure}

Return values of custom commands added to \emph{ScriptInterpreter} do not
offer any particular support for lists. In case list return values are
needed, they might be represented as a string with space separated values.

\subsection{ScriptInterpreter}

Class \emph{ScriptInterpreter} encapsulates the interpreter library
functionality.  It is an abstract class: its pure virtual methods are
implemented in a concrete interpreter class, such as \emph{TclInterpreter}
described in~\ref{ssec:tcl-interp}.  The class interface was inspired by Tcl
library API.  Still, the interface is so simple and general that it should
be possible to implement support for any scripting language with it.


\emph{ScriptInterpreter} provides an unique, consistent client interface for
adding scripting support to the application.  The interface consists of
following methods.  Methods that the derived classes are supposed to
implement are marked with "[pure virtual]".

\paragraph{addCustomCommand(command :  CustomCommand*)}
Adds a new \emph{CustomCommand} to the interpreter. Simply copies and adds
the custom command to a \verb|map<string, CustomCommand>|, where the name
string is obtained by the \emph{CustomCommand} itself. Overwriting an
existing \emph{CustomCommand} is not an error.

The protected method
\verb|addCustomCommandToInterpreter()| is called to ensure the new command
is added to the internal structures of the interpreter implementation library.

The parameter has to be a pointer to avoid splicing, that is the type info
is not lost.

\paragraph{removeCustomCommand(commandName : string)}
Removes a \emph{CustomCommand} with \emph{commandName} key from
ScriptInterpreter.

The protected method
\verb|removeCustomCommandFromInterpreter()| is called to ensure the command
is removed from the internal structures of the interpreter implementation
library.

\paragraph{customCommand(commandName : string) : CustomCommand*}
Returns the CustomCommand object associated with given name.

A simple map lookup. NULL is returned in case CustomCommand with given
name is not found.

Bookkeeping of CustomCommands is required to be able to refer to other
CustomCommands within a CustomCommand. For example the ``help''
CustomCommand could be implemented using this feature.

\paragraph{customCommandsSortedByName() : vector<string>}
Returns a vector of custom command names registered in the
ScriptInterpreter. The list is sorted by name, starting from 'a'. This is
used at least by a custom command 'help' that prints a listing of available
commands when it's called without any arguments.

\paragraph{setResult(result : DataObject*)}
Stores the result of the last executed command.

Called by CustomCommands to set their result. After saving the result to an
internal variable, this method calls \verb|setResultToInterpreter()| to set
the result also to the concrete interpreter. To denote that the result is
error information instead of real result, \verb|setInterpreterError()| is
called.

\paragraph{result() : string}
Returns the result of last executed command as a string.


\paragraph{setError(state : bool)}

Sets the interpreter's error state.

The error state implies that the result string obtained with a result() call
is an error string instead of execution result.

\paragraph{error() : bool}

Returns the interpreter's error state. See above method for explanation.

\paragraph{setVariable(interpreterVariableName : string, value : string)}
Template method for setting the value of a variable of type string in
interpreter.

Creates a new \emph{DataObject} and calls virtual method
\verb|setVariable()| with the \emph{DataObject} as a parameter.

\paragraph{setVariable(interpreterVariableName : string, value : int)}
Template method for setting the value of a variable of integer type in
interpreter.  Creates a new \emph{DataObject} and calls virtual method
\verb|setVariable()| with the \emph{DataObject} as a parameter.

\paragraph{variableStringValue(interpreterVariableName : string) : string}
Template method for accessing the value of a variable of the scripting
language as a string.  Obtains the value for the variable as a
\emph{DataObject} using \verb|variable()|, and returns its value interpreted
as string.

\paragraph{variableIntegerValue(interpreterVariableName : string) : int}
Template method for accessing the value of a variable of the scripting
language as an integer number.  Obtains the value for the variable as a
\emph{DataObject} using \verb|variable()|, and returns its value interpreted
as string.

\paragraph{processScriptFile(scriptFileName : string) : Boolean}
Processes a script file.  Returns false on script execution failure.
Exceptions are thrown if the failure is not due to script errors, but to
other causes, for example when the file is not found.  Template method that
reads the file line-by-line and calls \verb|interpret()| with the read line.

\paragraph{finalize()}

This method should be called before deleting ScriptInterpreter derived
class instance.

Custom commands are deleted from the interpreter by calling
\emph{removeCustomCommand()} for each custom command in the custom command
map. This results in calling the \emph{removeCustomCommandFromInterpreter()}
implemented by the concrete ScriptInterpreter which removes the references
to the custom commands from the scripting library.

Separate finalization method is provided because one cannot call abstract
methods (removeCustomCommandFromInterpreter()) in destructor. Reason why
they cannot be called is obvious: derived class part is destructed at the
point the destructor of the parent class is run, therefore it doesn't make
sense to call the abstract method which is implemented in the destructed
derived class only.

Destructor of ScriptInterpreter only checks that finalize() has been called.
If it haven't been called, error log is written about it for helping in
debugging the errors (and memory leaks) it might cause.

\paragraph{setLineReader(reader : LineReader*)}

Sets the LineReader for the interpreter. LineReader can be used for example
for getting more input for ScriptInterpreter. CustomCommands may also need
to access LineReader. They do it by asking it from ScriptInterpreter.

\paragraph{lineReader() : LineReader*}

Returns a pointer to LineReader instance.

\paragraph{initialize(argc, argv, context : InterpreterContext*, reader : LineReader*) [pure virtual]}
Initializes the interpreter. Interpreter library is initialized here.
\emph{argc and argv} are possible command line arguments passed when
starting the program. These variables can be set to the interpreter
library's internal variables so they can be used in scripts. \emph{context}
is used to pass arbitrary data to the Interpreter, this data is used by
CustomCommands to do their job. \emph{reader} is a LineReader instance given
to ScriptInterpreter.

Separate initialization method is provided to make sure the concrete
interpreter provides possibility to set command line arguments to interpreter
variables in initialization.


\paragraph{setVariableToInterpreter(name : string, value : const Logical View::DataObject\&) [pure virtual]}
Sets the value of a variable in the interpreter.  Concrete interpreter
implementations must provide this.

\paragraph{variable(name : string) : DataObject [pure virtual]}
Returns the value of a variable of the scripting language.

\paragraph{interpret(commandLine : string) : Boolean [pure virtual]}
Processes a line of script.  Returns `true' on success, `false' if a
language error occurs.  On failure, interpreter is set to error state
with \verb|setError(true)| and the error string is set with
\verb|setResult()| which can be queried with \verb|result()| by the client.

\paragraph{setResultToInterpreter(value : const DataObject\&) [pure virtual]}

Sets the DataObject to be the return value of the last executed command in
the concrete interpreter.

\paragraph{addCustomCommandToInterpreter(command : CustomCommand*) [pure virtual]}
Adds a single custom command to the interpreter. This method should be
implemented with functionality that register the custom command to actual
interpreter library. Bookkeeping of CustomCommand objects is responsibility of
the addCustomCommand() which calls this method.

The parameter has to be a pointer to avoid splicing, that is the type info
is not lost.


\paragraph{removeCustomCommandFromInterpreter(command : CustomCommand*) [pure virtual]}

Unregisters the given CustomCommand from the scripting library to make sure
the custom command is not recognized anymore by the scripting library and
won't be called accidentally.

\subsection{TclInterpreter}
\label{ssec:tcl-interp}

Tcl implementation of the ScriptInterpreter. Here are some thoughts on how
the pure virtual methods could be implemented in case of Tcl library.
Methods not covered here should be trivial to implement with Tcl API calls.

\paragraph{\~{}TclInterpreter()}

Finalization of the Tcl library should be done here.

\paragraph{initialize()}
Create a new Tcl interpreter instance with a call to
\verb|Tcl_CreateInterp()|.

The source of \verb|Tcl_Main()| is a good source for information on how to
do this. The manual pages of Tcl (man \verb|Tcl_CreateInterp|) should
provide valuable information, too. The interpreter is not initialized
``conventionally'', by creating a custom \verb|Tcl_AppInit()| and then
calling \verb|Tcl_Main()|. Instead, write our own code resembling the
\verb|Tcl_Main()|. This makes it easier to have multiple instantiations of
the ScriptInterpreter. You'll notice this when you dig into details more.

\paragraph{setLastReturnValue()}

Converts the DataObject instance to Tcl\_Obj and calls Tcl\_SetObjResult()
with the converted object as an argument.

\paragraph{addCustomCommandToInterpreter()}

The implementation of this function is based on the fact that the
\emph{Tcl\_CreateObjCommand()} allows entering custom data with
the \emph{ClientData} parameter.

When registering a new custom command to the Tcl library, a single
static custom command handler function is used for all the registered
CustomCommand objects.
A pointer to the CustomCommand object is stored in ClientData field so the
real functionality can be called in the ``redirector'' custom command function.
The function consists of code similar to this:

\begin{verbatim}
  int
  TclInterpreter::customCommandRedirector(ClientData cd, Tcl_Interp* interp,
                                          int objc, Tcl_Obj *CONST objv[]) {
     vector<DataObject> args;

     // ...
     // convert objc and objv[] to DataObjects in args vector here
     // ...

     CustomCommand* targetCommand = static_cast<CustomCommand*>(cd);
     assert(cd != NULL);

     if (targetCommand->execute(args)) {
       setError(false);
       return TCL_OK;
     } else {
       setError(true);
       return TCL_ERROR;
     }
  }
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{CustomCommand}
Custom commands are added to interpreter by defining new CustomCommand
classes.  CustomCommand is an abstract class that implements only
the simple access methods and rest of the methods are supposed to be
implemented by concrete CustomCommands.


\paragraph{string name()}

Returns the name of the command.  The name is used to invoke the command,
e.g., ``info'' or ``run''.  The name is hard-coded in the concrete custom
command class: all instances of a class have the same name.  (Although
multiple instances of the same class are not usually needed.)


\paragraph{context() : InterpreterContext*}
Returns a pointer to the InterpreterContext object.

This is used by CustomCommand objects to access the "context" data. Context
data is the "model" data, that is the data the CustomCommands access and
modify. In Simulator's case the data is a SimulationFrontend instance.

Because not all CustomCommands need the ``context'' data, having a
\emph{InterpreterContext} pointer in a \emph{CustomCommand} is not
mandatory. In case of a missing \emph{Interpreter} pointer this method
returns NULL to indicate a possible programming error.

\paragraph{setContext(context : InterpreterContext*)}

Sets the \emph{InterpreterContext} pointer.

\paragraph{setInterpreter(ScriptInterpreter* si)}

Some CustomCommands need to access services provided by the
ScriptInterpreter interface. For example ``help'' command may need to access
other commands connected to the interpreter to get the help text assigned to
commands. This method sets the \emph{ScriptInterpreter} instance which is
used in these cases.

\paragraph{ScriptInterpreter* interpreter()}

Because not all CustomCommands need interpreter services, having a
\emph{ScriptInterpreter} pointer in a \emph{CustomCommand} is not mandatory.
In case of a missing \emph{ScriptInterpreter} pointer this method returns
NULL to indicate a possible programming error.

\addvspace{1cm}
\emph{The rest of the methods are pure virtual and are implemented by the
  concrete custom commands.}

\paragraph{execute(arguments : const vector<DataObject>\&) : bool}
This is the real beef of the whole class. In this function the
functionality of the command is implemented. This is called from the
implementation specific command handler function with the arguments
converted to DataObjects.

In case execution of a command fails, `false' is returned, `true' otherwise.
The result of the command execution is set by calling \verb|setResult()| on
the given interpreter before returning.

\paragraph{helpText() : string}
Returns a brief help message describing this command.  This method makes it
possible to implement a special custom command that queries different
commands for help text and shows it to the client.

\subsection{InterpreterContext}
Container for data that is handled by CustomCommands.
SimulatorInterpreterContext holds a pointer to SimulatorFrontend* so
CustomCommands may access it in their \verb|execute()|.

\subsection{DataObject}
Represents data of arbitrary type that can be manipulated by the scripting
language.  Idea from \verb|Tcl_Obj|.  Does conversions ``on demand'' and
stores the converted value, so conversion results are ``cached''.  In case
conversion fails, an exception is thrown.

\subsection{Script class}

Script class is a helper class that contains lines of script that can
be executed on demand. It is a base class for
helper classes ConditionScript and ExpressionScript
(see Figure~\ref{fig:script_helper_classes}).

\begin{figure}[tb]
\centerline{\psfig{figure=eps/ScriptHelperClasses.eps,width=1.0\textwidth}}
\caption{Script helper classes.}
\label{fig:script_helper_classes}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Script(interpreter : ScriptInterpreter*, scriptLine : string)}

Pointer to the interpreter that is supposed to execute the script is
given in construction. \emph{scriptLine} is the line of script to be
evaluated.

\paragraph{Script(interpreter : ScriptInterpreter*, script : const vector<string>\&)}

This constructor is like the previous, except it allows entering multiple
lines of script with the \emph{script} parameter.


\paragraph{execute() : DataObject}

Executes the script and returns the result as a DataObject object. Also
stores the result of the last execution to a member variable which can be
retrieved with method described next.

In case the script consist of multiple lines, each line is executed
separately and the result of the last line is returned.

If execution of script fails for unexpected reason (for example syntax
error), an exception is thrown.

\paragraph{lastResult() : DataObject}

Returns the result of last execution, if any. If execute() was never
called, throws an exception. This is a helper method used for caching
the script execution result.

\paragraph{script() : vector<string>}

Returns the script as a string vector.

\subsection{ConditionScript class}

ConditionScript is derived from Script class to provide a helper class that
contains a script that defines a condition for some action. The result of the
execution of this script is considered to be only true or false. If execution
of script produces any other result than integer 0, it is considered true.

This class is used at least by break points that contain conditions
(see \ref{subsec:breakpoint_class} for details).

This class provides same type of constructors as the parent class.

\paragraph{conditionOk() : bool}

Returns true if the return value of execution is not integer zero. This means
that even if the script returns a string, it is considered a ``true'' result.

An empty condition script is considered a special case: when it's evaluated
it's not passed to interpreter, but true is returned immediately instead. This
kind of condition can be used as a ``default'' condition to signal that
there is no condition (execute always).

Possible exceptions from execute() call are spilled.

\subsection{ExpressionScript}

ExpressionScript is used to inspect changes in the result of script execution.
This is used to implement watches.

This class provides same type of constructors as the parent class.

\paragraph{resultChanged() : bool}

Returns true if result of script execution has changed since the last call to
this function.

Saves current last result value to a temporary variable, runs execute()
and sees if the value differs. When this function is called the first time,
that is there is no previous value to compare to, this function returns
false.

Possible exceptions from execute() call are spilled.

\subsection{SimulatorInterpreter}

A convenience subclass of \emph{TclInterpreter} that encapsulated all
initialization activity required by the interpreter of Simulator. In the
future, it could be optionally derived from other interpreter
implementations, like a Python interpreter. \emph{SimulatorInterpreter}
creates and holds the SimulatorInterpreterContext instance. Creates and
deletes the CustomCommands of simulator and registers them to the
interpreter.

\chapter{IMPLEMENTATION}

This chapter describes the implementation of the major features of the Simulator.
Implementation descriptions are written in a way that they provide the minimal
set of information needed to implement the features the intended way. No details are described.
Additionally, a plan for the order of the implementation of the features is given in
\emph{Implementation Milestones} section.

\section{Implementation Descriptions}

The features that are described are picked in such a way that after understanding how they are
implemented, it should be trivial to understand the way to implement the rest of the features.
For example, describing how to add each different type of breakpoint is not necessary, because they
are special cases of the implementation description in Section~\ref{sec:impl_add_breakpoint}. On the
other hand, it does not make sense to describe how to implement the command ``run'' as it's basically
implemented by executing a sequence of ``step'' commands (Section~\ref{sec:impl_stepping}) with stop
condition evaluation after each step.

Most feature implementation descriptions contain sequence diagrams to illustrate
the interactions between relevant objects.

\subsection{Simulation Initialization}

Simulation is initialized by registering the machine and the program to be simulated to
the \emph{SimulatorFrontend}, as illustrated in the sequence diagram of Figure~\ref{fig:impl_init}.

The \emph{CustomCommands} owned by the \emph{SimulatorInterpreter} that are responsible for executing
commands ``prog'' and ``mach'' (or ``conf'') call the methods of the \emph{SimulatorFrontend} used for
loading the program and the machine, respectively.

When simulation is started by executing, for example, the ``run'' command, \emph{SimulatorFrontend}
creates a new \emph{SimulatorController}, and gives the loaded program and machine (or an instance of
\emph{UniversalMachine} in case a machine was not loaded) as arguments to its constructor.

\emph{SimulatorController} uses \emph{MachineStateBuilder} to construct \emph{Machine State Model} from
the given \emph{Machine Object Model}. What is missing from the diagram is that
\emph{SimulatorController} is responsible for instantiating the \emph{Memory} models as
described by the address space data in the \emph{Machine}. These memory
instances are given to the \emph{MachineStateBuilder} when calling
the \emph{build()} method to make it possible for the \emph{FUStates}
that access memory to work.

Finally, \emph{SimulatorController} preprocesses the program to simulate.
Preprocessing converts a POM \emph{Program} instance to an
\emph{InstructionMemory} containing \emph{ExecutableInstructions}.
Preprocessing is delegated to \emph{SimProgramBuilder} which uses given
\emph{StateLocator} instance to search the corresponding state objects for
components of the Machine Object Model (\emph{Component} instances). During
preprocessing, references to components contained in the program are
replaced with references to state objects.

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centerline{\psfig{figure=eps/Seq_init_simulation.eps,width=1.0\textwidth}}
\caption{Initializing Simulation}
\label{fig:impl_init}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Stepping a Program}
\label{sec:impl_stepping}

Implementation of ``step'' command is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:impl_stepping}.

Implementation is straightforward: the \emph{CustomCommand} instance that implements ``step''
calls \emph{step()} of the \emph{SimulatorFrontend} which calls \emph{step()} of
the \emph{SimulatorController} instance created for the running simulation.

What happens inside \emph{SimulatorController} and \emph{Machine State Model} during a simulation
cycle can be understood from Figure~\ref{fig:msm_simple_simucycle}.

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centerline{\psfig{figure=eps/Seq_stepping_program.eps,width=1.0\textwidth}}
\caption{Stepping a Program}
\label{fig:impl_stepping}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Execution Tracing}
\label{sec:impl_exec_tracing}

Tracing the execution (Figure~\ref{fig:impl_exec_tracing}) is implemented using the \textit{Observer}
design pattern. \emph{Event Handler} module (Chapter~\ref{ch:event-handler}) is used to implement
the \textit{Observer} pattern.
The \emph{Informer} class of \emph{Event Handler} module relays event messages to
interested parties (\emph{Listeners}). Objects that implement \emph{Listener} interface may receive
event notifications by registering themselves to the \emph{Informer}.

When simple execution tracing is enabled, \emph{SimulatorFrontend} creates an instance
of \emph{ExecutionTracker}, and registers it to listen to clock cycle advance events.
\emph{SimulatorController} informs the \emph{Informer} when such an event happens, which informs
all \emph{Listeners} interested in that event. Among those listeners is the \emph{ExecutionTracker}
instance the \emph{SimulatorFrontend} registered at the moment simple execution tracing was enabled.

When the \emph{ExecutionTracker} is notified about the event by calling the \verb|handleEvent()| method,
it writes the information it tracks to the execution trace database after retrieving the information
from the classes (\textit{subjects} in the \textit{Observer} pattern) that have access to it. In this
case \emph{SimulatorController} is asked about the count of clocks passed and the current program counter
address.

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centerline{\psfig{figure=eps/Seq_execution_tracing.eps,width=1.0\textwidth}}
\caption{Execution Tracing}
\label{fig:impl_exec_tracing}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Adding a Breakpoint}
\label{sec:impl_add_breakpoint}

Break Points are added by using the \emph{Debugging System} module
(Chapter~\ref{ch:debugging_system}). \emph{SimulatorFrontend} owns an
instance of \emph{BreakpointManager} which keeps book of \emph{Breakpoints}.
When a new breakpoint is added with method \verb|addBreakpoint()|,
\emph{SimulatorFrontend} delegates the breakpoint to the

\subsection{Stopping Because of a Breakpoint}

Stopping at breakpoint is implemented using the \emph{Event Handler}
mechanism as briefly described in Section~\ref{sec:impl_exec_tracing}.
\emph{BreakpointManager} listens to program counter change events and when
it sees a program counter change to an instruction address watched by a
breakpoint, it tells \emph{SimulatorController} to stop before executing the
next instruction. \emph{Breakpoints} may be conditional, and because of
this, the breakpoint watching the instruction address is asked whether the
condition is true by calling its \verb|conditionOK()| method before
triggering the breakpoint. Sequence of method calls is illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:impl_stopping_breakpoint}.

\section{Implementation Milestones}

The plan for implementing the features of the processor simulator is
represented in an implementation milestone list. The list is divided in
pre 1.0 versions, each version representing a set of main features to be
implemented in that version.

% TODO: complete the list
\begin{list}{version}{}
\item 0.1 %
Simulation of sequential code. The first commands of the CLI: ``prog'', ``run'',
"until", "disassemble" and ``stepi''. The workings of sequential simulation is
verified with printouts (by using a special "stdout" operation) in the simulated
program. Detection of the last executed instruction.

\item 0.2 (Demo for the steering group meeting of May, 2005)%
Execution tracking, i.e., the minimal data needed by Estimator. Breakpoints.
Stopping the simulation by hitting "Ctrl-C" in the command line client.

\item 0.3 %
Simulation of parallel code loaded from TPEF. Needs assembler, or any kind of
parallelizing scheduler algorithm to verify.

\end{list}

\chapter{REJECTED ALTERNATIVES}

% Rejected alternatives for (parts of) the design should be listed here with
% the reasoning and date the alternative was dumped. For future reference.

\begin{description}
\item[17.11.2004 --- Semaphore for Lock Requests.]%
  Use of semaphores or counters to handle multiple concurrent lock requests
  has been rejected, because it is possible and safe to do without. Internal
  locks are refreshed at every simulated clock cycle, so there is no need to
  count the number of concurrent lock requests (see
  Section~\ref{ssec:multi-locks}. External locks are handled basically as
  signals coming from a line, therefore potential lock request generators
  are responsible for avoiding concurrent lock requests (see pending issue
  in Section~\ref{ch:pending:exo-locks}.

\item[18.11.2004 --- MOM Inheritance or Composition for MSM.]%
  MSM objects do not duplicate data that is already stored in the
  corresponding MOM (sub)component. Either MSM objects are inherited from
  the corresponding MOM objects, or MOM components could be members of
  corresponding state objects. Inheritance is more logical and cleaner, as
  it avoids delegation methods for each MOM attribute that is available in
  MSM objects.

  Both inheritance and composition have been rejected because they build
  into MSM a strong dependence to MOM. The chosen design allows for MSM
  object hierarchies completely independent from MOM.

\item[07.12.2004 --- MSM Builder Owning Constructed MachineState.]%
  The \emph{MachineStateBuilder} returns just a reference to the constructed
  \emph{MachineState} object. This implies that the builder must be the
  owner and responsible of destruction of the object. This creates potential
  for hard-to-find memory bugs:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item %
    Creates a distinction between \emph{MachineState} instances created by
    builder (and owned by it) and other instances (created, for example, by
    copy method or by opposite of serialisation). Some must be deleted by
    clients, some by builder.
  \item %
    Builder cannot be destroyed until the \emph{MachineState} object it
    created is destroyed. It must be kept alive for no other good reason.
  \item %
    Clients must create one builder for every machine state object they need
    to create from a \emph{Machine}. This is cumbersome.
  \end{enumerate}

\item[31.12.2004 --- Optimised implementation of \emph{ExecutableMove}]%
  Redefine \emph{ExecutableMove} as a class hierarchy in which each concrete
  subclass accesses only concrete class types instead of the interfaces
  \emph{ReadableState} and \emph{WritableState}. This implementation avoid a
  chain of virtual calls: for example, one in \verb|executeRead()| and one
  in \verb|value()| of \emph{ReadableState}.

  Rejected because the alternative (\emph{ExecutableMove} without virtual
  methods, model every source and destination as \emph{ReadableState} and
  \emph{WritableState}, respectively) also avoids one of the two virtual
  calls and seems more regular.

\item[12.01.2005 --- MSM State Object Locator]%
  \emph{MachineStateBuilder} can return a copy of the state locator used
  during construction of machine state to any client.  A possible method to
  provide public state locators outside state builder:
  \begin{description}
  \item[locator(state : const MachineState\&) : StateLocator] %
  \end{description}

  Returning a state locator by means of an independent method has several
  technical problems.

  One possible way to create new copies of a locator with an alternative
  target \emph{MachineState} instance is a \emph{MachineStateBuilder}
  method:
  \begin{description}
  \item[copyLocator(state : const MachineState\&) : StateLocator\&]
  \end{description}
\end{description}

\chapter{IDEAS FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT}

% Ideas that are not part of the design yet but that might be added in the
% future are listed here. This is to have ideas written down somewhere.
% This list should contain the date of addition, the idea described briefly
% and the inventor of the idea.
\begin{description}

\item[22.11.2004 --- Support for segmented busses.]%
  Segments are modeled as several concurrent moves assigned to the same bus.
  TPEF provides base support for segmented busses, it simply accepts several
  moves assigned to the same bus in a single TTA instruction.
%
  One possible solution is to refer in MSM to ``virtual busses'' that are
  generated for each segment.  --- P. J‰‰skel‰inen.

  Another solution, closer to the machine structure, is to implement bus
  state as a fixed-length list of \emph{SimValue} objects. Each list element
  corresponds to a segment. --- A. Cilio

\item[14.12.2004 --- Table of syscall names in trace database.]%
  The name of the system calls could be stored in a separate table of the
  trace database. It is questionable, however, the status if this name
  information. The system call number is what matters, and different syscall
  emulators could all produce correct results in response to the same
  syscall number. The name attached to such syscall is irrelevant and
  perhaps should be queried directly to the emulation system (or the
  simulator). Alternatively, the name of the syscall could be stored in
  TPEF.  --- A. Cilio

\item[13.01.2005 --- Implementation of break points.]%
  Currently break points will be implemented using the event handler
  mechanism. Break points watch program counter changes, and when it changes
  to the address the breakpoint is set to, simulation is stopped. It's a
  quite inefficient way to implement break points.

  Maybe in a future version we could mimic one usual way to implement
  break points in native environments: instruction injection. We "inject" an
  instruction to the breakpoint address (a software interrupt call). The
  handler executes the replaced instruction and stops simulation. This could
  be implemented with a special \emph{ExecutableInstruction}, which contains
  the replaced \emph{ExecutableInstruction}, and of which \emph{execute()}
  does what I described in the previous sentences. --- P. J‰‰skel‰inen

\end{description}


\chapter{PENDING ISSUES}

\section{Relation between Requests and Late Results}
\label{ch:pending:request-result}

Problem: how to tell apart late-coming results from different requests? For
example, how to tell what was the access request of a late-coming result
from memory?

In the case of memory, one of the complicating factors is the (important)
requirement that the results delivered by memory do not need to be in the
same order of the read access requests.  The only exception is for access
requests to the same address, which are satisfied in order.

The problem seems solvable for all but one case.  Solvable cases are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \label{item:many-addr}%
  When different requests have different addresses, the distinction should
  be trivial, since reading late results requires to specify the address of
  the result.
\item \label{item:one-addr}%
  When different requests have the same target address and are sent in
  different cycles, the earliest request is satisfied first, and so on until
  the last access request to the address.
\end{enumerate}

Case (\ref{item:many-addr}) still leaves the problem of where to keep the
address that needs to be passed when the client (OSAL) tests memory for
late-coming results.  The address is not passed by OSAL client via the OSAL
API \verb|lateResult()|.  It could be stored in the object state instance,
but then load operation behavior model becomes significantly less
efficient, and the burden on the operation designer is greater.  Moreover,
having a model with state may imply less efficient code optimization and
scheduling.

Case (\ref{item:one-addr}) is even more problematic, because the memory does
not allow, with its current interface, to tell which was the request of the
current late result that it returns.  On the other hand, the clients of OSAL
that generate such memory requests should be independent from each other.

These problems are treated in greater detail in the Memory Model Module
Design Notes~\cite{MemoryModuleDesign}.

Another difficult case is when different function units send a read access
request to the \emph{same} address in the \emph{same} cycle.  Possible
solutions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \label{item:strict-order} %
  The client must perform test for late coming results exactly in the same
  order of the memory requests that were sent in the same clock cycle.
\item \label{item:all-or-none}%
  The order of test for late coming results from requests that were sent in
  the same clock cycle can be relaxed, on condition that the memory module
  returns a valid result for all read access requests to the same address
  that were sent.
\end{enumerate}

Case (\ref{item:strict-order}) still leaves the same problem described above
for access requests to the same address in different cycles.

The condition stated in case (\ref{item:all-or-none}) is further explained
in the Memory Model Module Design Notes.


\section{Implementation of Instruction Simulation}
\label{ch:pending:core-control}

The key responsibility of Simulation Controller is to interpret TTA
instructions, that is, to simulate fetch-decode-execution.

The most complex part is the execution simulation.  A possible
implementation is described below.
%
\note{Most probably something different (even radically different) will be
implemented, and this should be moved to rejected alternatives.}

\paragraph{Overview.}
The execution function receives the fetched TTA instruction to be simulated.
Decoding is actually performed during execution, and really consists of
looking up the objects referred to by the fields of the moves contained in
the instruction.  Simulation of a cycle is split in two phases, transport
simulation and clock advancing:
\begin{verbatim}
execute(instruction);
nextClock();
\end{verbatim}

In turn, transport simulation (execution proper) is split in two phases:
\begin{verbatim}
moveOnBus(instruction);
moveToDestination(instruction);
\end{verbatim}

The first phase copies data from the sources specified by the moves of the
given \emph{instruction} into the busses (that is, updates the BusState
objects).

The second phase copies the values loaded on the busses into the
destinations.  When the destination is a triggering port of a function unit,
a new operation is simulated inside the \emph{FUState} object corresponding
to the function unit.

The machine state objects are stored in a data member of the SimCon class.

The following paragraphs describe each phase in detail.

\paragraph{Reading source values into busses.}
%
\begin{verbatim}
for each move m do
    if m.isImmediate() then
        result = m.srcValue()
    else
        SUnit = m.srcUnit()
        SUnit.readPort(m, result)
        if SUnit.isLocking() then
            globalLock = true
            pendingSourceTransports.insert(m)
        endif
    endif
    get busState, the state object of m.bus()
    busState.setValue(result)
end foreach
\end{verbatim}

\paragraph{Writing bus values into destinations.}
%
\begin{verbatim}
for each move m do
    get busState, the state object of m.bus()
    result = busState.value()
    destUnit = m.destUnit()
    // operation execution is triggered inside destUnit
    destUnit.writePort(m, result)
    if destUnit.isLocking() then
        globalLock = true
        pendingDestinationTransports.insert(m)
    endif
end foreach
\end{verbatim}

\paragraph{Clock advancing.}
%
\begin{verbatim}
for each function unit u do
    u.advanceClock(globalLock)
end foreach
\end{verbatim}

When clock advances, all function units are notified that a clock cycle is
completed.

When the processor is locked, the function units are informed that a clock
cycle has elapsed, but that no pipeline advancing must take place.  Units
that contain operations with simple, deterministic model, in this case,
return immediately.  If a unit contain any operations with complex model, it
should call the late-coming result method of such operations and update the
results stored in its pipeline model.  This is the only way to ensure that,
even when the processor is locked, results coming from an external module
are not lost.

\paragraph{Handling global locks.}
The splitting of transport simulation in two phases is probably needed for
cycle-accurate simulation.  It seems reasonable that at least some system
models will require that all read-locks of a TTA processor are resolved
before any write-lock can occur.

The code of the two execution phases (as well as the fetching of a new
instruction) is not run at all if the processor is locked:
\begin{verbatim}
if globalLock == true then
    waitForPendingTransports(instruction, globalLock)
else
    execute(instruction);
endif
\end{verbatim}

\paragraph{Interface details.}
The details of these interfaces may change.  For example, the way a state
object of a processor component is looked up given a move that uses that
component, is not indicated in the pseudocode above.  There are two main
possibilities.  If \emph{instruction} is the ``plain'' object of the Program
Object Model, then its references to Machine Object Model components must be
used as keys to lookup the corresponding state object in MSM:
\begin{verbatim}
// looks up bus state in msm_ private member of SimCon
BusState& bState = lookup(instruction->bus());
\end{verbatim}

Alternatively, if \emph{instruction} belongs to a Simulator-specific object
model of the program, then the component state lookup could be as simple as
a pointer indirection:
\begin{verbatim}
BusState& bState = instruction->busState();
\end{verbatim}


\section{Code Duplication in Tracked Memory Proxies}
\label{ch:pending:proxy-code-dupl}

It is possible that certain Proxy implementations (such as the
\emph{TrackedMemory} contain some amount of code duplication with respect to
the class they are clients of.

\section{Processor State on Lock Condition}
\label{ch:pending:locks}

Lock-inducing transports ``split'' the state of the processor in two:
\begin{enumerate}
\item %
  If the lock occurs while reading the transport source, all data transports
  simulated before the lock-inducing transport have their source value
  already copied onto the transport bus.  All data transports after the
  lock-inducing transport are not yet executed.
\item %
  If the lock occurs while writing the transport destination, all data
  transports simulated before the lock-inducing transport are completed.
  The data transports after the lock-inducing transport have only their
  source value copied onto the transport bus.
\end{enumerate}

The main nuisance of this implementation is that the Simulator Controller
must know which transports must be completed when the lock is deactivated.
This means that a set of pending transports must be maintained.  There are
several variations to this approach.  A possible variant is that upon
triggering a lock condition, the Simulator Controller completes all
remaining data transports before actually entering the locked state.  This
approach minimises the number of pending transports, but does not guarantee
that there is only one pending transport, because several operations may
lock the processor simultaneously.

\section{External Locks}
\label{ch:pending:exo-locks}

Can external locks be generated via the same Simulator Controller interface
used by clients that generate internal locks (mostly, MSM) or should they
use a different interface? If external locks use the same interface, then
this can only work if:
\begin{enumerate}
\item%
  External modules always test whether the processor is already in a locked
  state before rising the lock signal themselves.
\item%
  External modules don't rise the lock signal until the processor is in
  unlocked state.
\item%
  Once active, the lock remains active until the source of the lock request
  lowers the signal. The source of the lock doesn't need to repeat the
  request at every clock cycle (as it is for the internal locks).
\end{enumerate}

A sequence of lock-unlock-lock requests might be the following:

\begin{tabular}[h]{|r|p{0.85\textwidth}|}
\hline
 cycle &   event  \\
\hline
  0    &  \textbf{step()} \\
\hline
  1    &  \textbf{lock()}: lock request from an internal source (for
          example, a load-store unit) \\
  1    &  \textbf{step()} \\
\hline
  2    &  an external source wants to request a lock but sees that the
          processor is already locked, and waits \\
  2    &  \textbf{step()} \\
\hline
  3    &  the lock condition of the internal source expires (for example,
          because the result waited for has arrived from an external
          module) \\
  3    &  \textbf{unlock()}: the internal source unlocks the processor \\
  3    &  the external source is notified that the signal at the lock port
          of the core processor has changed \\
  3    &  \textbf{lock()}: the external source sees that the processor is
          not locked, and sends a lock request to it \\
\hline
  4    &  \textbf{step()}: for any other potential source of locks
          (internal or external), it appears as if the processor had been
          locked all the time \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Races can occur if multiple lock requests from different external modules
arrive at the same cycle. One one of the should be allowed to rise the
signal, and the others should wait. [[This part needs to be clarified!]]

\section{Multicast}
\label{ch:pending:multicast}

Currently, support for moves that multi-cast their data in not fully worked
out. In TPEF~\cite{TPEF-specs}, multicast should be easy to add.

In simulator design support for multicasts could require a new composite
type of writable state object. This means that a single \emph{WritableState}
of an \emph{ExecutableMove} instance actually contains a set of
destinations, each modelled by a separate instance of \emph{WritableState}.

\section{Implementation of Unbounded RF State}
\label{ch:pending:unbounded-rf}

For realistic uses of a pool of program variables or virtual registers, it
is reasonable to assume that when a register at index \emph{i} is used in
the program most registers at lower index numbers are also used.

Thus, a possible optimisation for realistic uses of unbounded RF is to
create all registers between requested index and previous maximum index
whenever a register at a new highest index is requested.

A related, realistic optimisation is to actually create a minimum set of
registers at construction time.

\section{Caching Binding Data of OperationExecutor}
\label{ch:pending:binding-cache}

To speedup normal binding operation, references to port state objects could
be looked up once at the time an operation executor is added to the
\emph{FUState}. Alternatively, references to the \emph{FUPortState} objects
could be found and cached only the first time the port is looked up.
