- CycleOptimizer:
  - should be split to explorer plugins, now a single applibs class
    with multiple useful methods
  - create explorer plugins:
    - [DONE] GrowMachine 
      = optimizes cycle count by adding resources
    - MinimizeMachine (minimizeBusFURF)
      = removes resources until the real time requirements of apps are 
        not reached anymore.
    - [DONE] Pass frequency to the new MinimizeMachine and minimize fu/rf 
      according to all programs max cycle times.
  - Check that all CycleOptimizers functionality is implemented in plugins
    and remove the module.

- initial machine generator:
    - should be able to use a config as a starting point. initial adf as default.
    - expects default minimal op set that must be found from machine.
    - no sequential program, no automatic selection of ops.
    - adds fus, rfs, busses and so on only.

- new plugin for op addition to given configuration.
    - paramaters for (custom) ops addition to the machine.

- new plugin for to handle immediate templates.
    - Minimize busses should consider immediate templates, remove and create
      new.

- DesingSpaceExplorer:
    - timeout/max cycle count for simulate.
    - watchdog thread (boost), or timer to simulator.

- selectComponents:
  - isn't this a generic exploration method that should be moved to 
  the base class or to ComponentImplementationSelector

- tcecc support:
  - should be able to read program.bc instead of sequential_program 
  - call tcecc instead of scheduler to compile 
  - no sequential simulation: initial machine generator simply uses
    initial.adf     

- testing:
  - (FrequencySweepExplorer) create a (long) systemtest with at least 3 
    applications with realistic realtime requirements, explore and verify the
    result
  - simple FrequencySweepExplorer long system test
    /home/wor/work/svnroot/trunk/tce/systemtest/bintools/Scheduler/tests/FFT/r4fftditinplace_no_custom_op
  - tests for plugings that use more than one application.

- Update the documentation for the plugins.
  - state clearly what is needed in application dir for specific plugin.
