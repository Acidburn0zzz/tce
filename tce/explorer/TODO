- After writing adf/idf to the dsdb, delete them. Explorer is leaking memory
  quite efficiently now :)

- Explorer should be able to print out plugin parameters.
    - when refactoring the parameter functions move parameter error function
      up in the class hierarchy.

- clean MinimalOpSet before commiting.

- how to preserve frequency an max area limitations when selecting components
  when other plugins are called.

- ComponentAdder plugin is rather limited now.

Documentation:
- update the documentation for the plugins.
- state clearly what is needed in application dir for specific plugin.

Questions:
- what is needed from adf at minimum: minimal opset, guard-registers?

Tests:
- fix frequency sweep plugin long systemtest.
- simple FrequencySweepExplorer long system test
- (FrequencySweepExplorer) create a (long) systemtest with at least 3 
  applications with realistic realtime requirements, explore and verify the
  result, this is prob going to be too long test to run rutinely.
- tests for plugings that use more than one application.

Refactor/cleanups:
- make longest path selection of units in implementation selector module a
  function.
- LLVMBackend.hh compile/schedule functions to use const machine.
