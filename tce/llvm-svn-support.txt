tce-devel r1391:
llvm-trunk r144788: At least short tests pass.
Some explorer long test fails? maybe just bad luck that
it cannot remove anything?
SPU branch hint support broken.

r146931: jpeg works?, 146932 fail??

Notes:

Performance worsening at around r123400: No longer optimizes away "constant" parameters in qsort test.
