tce-devel r1705:
llvm-trunk r159312-r159349 works?
opencl needs LD_LIBRARY_PATH to be set to llvm lib.

Notes:

159349 changed some DIScope interfaces.

this broke linking of TCE when wrong header path was used(old header)

Denbench uses tce-llvm-ld from install location 
- may break when not installed, or old version installed.
