tce-devel r1711:
llvm-trunk r159312-r162000 works.
opencl needs LD_LIBRARY_PATH to be set to llvm lib.

Notes:

r163000: pocl breaks, breaking opencl test.

159950: opt: Attributes.cpp:317: llvm::AttrListPtr llvm::AttrListPtr::removeAttr(unsigned int, llvm::Attributes) const: Assertion `!(Attrs & Attribute::Alignment) && "Attempt to exclude alignment!"' failed.


Denbench uses tce-llvm-ld from install location 
- may break when not installed, or old version installed.
