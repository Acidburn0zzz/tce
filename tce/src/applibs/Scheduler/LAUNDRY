Dirty pieces of code related to Scheduler which should be cleaned up
at some point.

Location of MoveNode and ProgramOperation
-----------------------------------------

Is it wise to keep them in PDG? Shouldn't this be a generic
wrapper over POM Move and operation to ease scheduling with graph-based
methods? Thus, own directory should be created for this and
maybe a container class for bookkeeping, etc.
