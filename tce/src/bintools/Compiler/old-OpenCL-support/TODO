- openCL: line number fix so error and warning messages point
  to the correct .cl line
  # 12 "Foobar.cl" seems to be the standard way to insert line
  numbers to the processed source
  
  cpp inserts its own which we should also take in account and
  fix
  
  especially insertion of trampoline code breaks the line numbers
  
- change SplitRegions pass so instead of looking for barriers while
  splitting it first looks for all "splitting points" and then does
  the splitting. This helps also adding artificial aplitting points,
  like the one needed on every block with a predeceddor in a region
  different to current one (otherwise I will go through loop exit
  without passing through loop entry before => does not dominate
  all instructions error).
