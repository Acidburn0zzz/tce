*** 20020930: malloc/longlong-emulation ***

  Patched by J.A. Bezemer <J.A.Bezemer@opensourcepartners.nl> to work
  on the experimental MOVE processor platform that doesn't support 64-bit
  long longs and has a broken alloca() (which is highly unportable BTW).
  - Converted alloca to malloc/free.
  - Added long long emulation based on wxWindows code and my own research/
    optimization.

  NOTE: This version DOES CONTAIN BUGS in "unimportant" parts of the code.
  ivorbisfile_example was tested with exactly three .ogg files and
  produced correct output, and that's all I need at this moment. Everything
  else is untested; solving problems is left as an excercise to the reader.
  Please excuse the quickly written and rather messy code.

  USAGE: ivorbisfile_example now has input/output from files, see source.
  New simple makefile to produce single binary, no library. Works on Linux.
  Native long long is used by default, -DLONGLONGEMUL to turn on emulation.

  LEGALESE: Inclusion of wxWindows code probably means that the new stuff
  is licensed under LGPL. However, everything except 64-bit multiplication
  and division is quite trivial. Multiplication has new versions by yours
  truly, licensed under Tremor license. Division is free to use (see
  source), but isn't used in ivorbisfile_example and so isn't tested at
  all. Everything in here that's my code is licensed under Tremor license.

*** 20020517: 1.0.2 ***

  Playback bugfix to floor1; mode mistakenly used for sizing instead
  of blockflag

*** 20020515: 1.0.1 ***

  Added complete API documentation to source tarball.  No code
  changes.

*** 20020412: 1.0.1 ***

  Fixed a clipping bug that affected ARM processors; negative
  overflows were being properly clipped, but then clobbered to
  positive by the positive overflow chec (asm_arm.h:CLIP_TO_15)

*** 20020403: 1.0.0 ***
